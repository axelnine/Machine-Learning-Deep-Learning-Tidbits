If you want to defend yourself in this lawsuit, you must respond to the eviction complaint
in writing on or before the deadline stated above. You must respond in writing even if no case
number has been assigned by the court yet.

You can respond to the complaint in writing by delivering a copy of a notice of
appearance or answer to your landlord's attorney (or your landlord if there is no attorney) by
personal delivery, mailing, or facsimile to the address or facsimile number stated below TO BE
RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THE DEADLINE STATED ABOVE. Service by facsimile
is complete upon successful transmission to the facsimile number, if any, listed in the summons.

The notice of appearance or answer must include the name of this case (plaintiff and
defendant(s)), your name, the street address where further legal papers may be sent, your
telephone number, if any, and your signature.

If there is a number on the upper right side of the eviction summons and complaint, you
must also file your original notice of appearance or answer with the court clerk by the deadline
for your written response.

You may demand that the plaintiff file this lawsuit with the court. If you do so, the
demand must be in writing and must be served upon the person signing the summons. Within
fourteen days after you serve the demand, the plaintiff must file this lawsuit with the court, or the
service on you of this summons and complaint will be void.

If you wish to seek the advice of an attorney in this matter, you should do so promptly so
that your written response, if any, may be served on time.

You may also be instructed in a separate order to appear for a court hearing on your
eviction. If you receive an order to show cause, you must personally appear at the hearing on the
date indicated in the order to show cause IN ADDITION TO delivering and filing your notice of
appearance or answer by the deadline stated above.

IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINT IN WRITING BY THE
DEADLINE STATED ABOVE YOU WILL LOSE BY DEFAULT. YOUR
LANDLORD MAY PROCEED WITH THE LAWSUIT EVEN IF YOU HAVE
MOVED OUT OF THE PROPERTY.
