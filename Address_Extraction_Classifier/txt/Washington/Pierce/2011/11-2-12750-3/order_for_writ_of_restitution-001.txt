2. RCW 59.12.090 states in relevant part: “The plaintiff at the time of commencing an action of
..-unlawful detainer, or at any time afterwards, may apply to the judge of the court in which the action is
pending for a writ of restitution restoring to the plaintiff the property in the complaint described....”

3. The summons and complaint for unlawful detainer were personally served on WILLIAM
STEERS on July 28, 2011, and defendant’s written response was due by 5:00 P.M. on August 4, 2011.
Defendant did not respond by the deadline and has not communicated in any way with my office since
service upon him. The affidavit of service is on file herein.

4, Defendant WILLIAM STEERS is on active duty in the military of the United States, however,
his military unit is not now and has not been deployed. Prior to initiating and during the pendency of
this unlawful detainer action, plaintiff's agent, Heather Kreider, has attempted to communicate with
defendant’s chain of command in his military unit to determine if a military reason exists for defendant’s
nonpayment, but no calls have been returned. Defendant WILLIAM STEERS is present on the property
and has come in to the management office acknowledging the delinquent rent and offering to make a
lump sum payment in September. At no time has he alleged that any military reason exists for his
nonpayment.

5. Pursuant to Section 301 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), formerly known as the
“Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act”, a court order for eviction of an active duty military member is
appropriate when in the opinion of the court the ability of the tenant to pay the agreed rent is not
materially affected by reason of such military service. 50 U.S.C.A. §531(b)(1). Pursuant to RCW
38.42.050(7) and 38.42.060, an order for eviction is appropriate where the defendant receives actual
notice of the proceedings, however, the defendant may petition the court for appointment of an attomey
and/or to stay the proceedings if certain strict conditions are met, including but not limited to
presentation of a letter from the commanding authority staling a military reason for defendant’s
nonappearance and nonpayment.
