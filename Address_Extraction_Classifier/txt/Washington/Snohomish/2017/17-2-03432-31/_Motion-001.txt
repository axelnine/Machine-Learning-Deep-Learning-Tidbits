4.2 Declaration of Joshua Dabling Regarding Motion for Order Allowing Alternative
Service

V. AUTHORITY AND ARGUMENT

5.1 RCW 59.12.085 allows alternative service by mail “When the plaintiff, after the
exercise of due diligence, is unable to personally serve the summons on the
defendant or defendants...”

5.2 RCW 59.18.370 states in part “A copy of the order [to show cause], together with a
copy of the summons and complaint if not previously served upon the defendant,
shall be served upon the defendant....”

5.3 As explained in the declaration of Attempted Service, various attempts have been
made to find and serve the defendant. The defendant has not opened his door to be
served the Order To Show Cause after three attempts on three different days at
different hours.

5.4 Therefore, it is proper to grant an order allowing service by mail.
