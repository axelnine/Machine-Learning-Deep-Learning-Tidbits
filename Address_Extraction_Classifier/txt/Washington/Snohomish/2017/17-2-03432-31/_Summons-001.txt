telephone number (if any), and your signature.

If there is a number on the upper right side of the eviction summons and complaint, you
must also file your original notice of appearance or answer with the court clerk by the deadline
for your written response.

You may demand that the plaintiff file this lawsuit with the court. If you do so, the demand
must be in writing and must be served upon the person signing the summons. Within fourteen
days after you serve the demand, the plaintiff must file this lawsuit with the court, or the
service on you of this summons and complaint will be void.

If you wish to seek the advice of an attorney in this matter, you should do so promptly so
that your written response, if any, may be served on time.

You may also be instructed in a separate order to appear for a court hearing on your
eviction. If you receive an order to show cause you must personally appear at the hearing on
the date indicated in the order to show cause IN ADDITION to delivering and filing your notice
of appearance or answer by the deadline stated above.

IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINT IN WRITING BY THE DEADLINE
STATED ABOVE YOU WILL LOSE BY DEFAULT. THE OWNER MAY PROCEED WITH THE
LAWSUIT, EVEN IF YOU HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE PROPERTY.

The notice of appearance or answer must be delivered to:
