a different grantee as designated by the purchaser following the trustee's sale, the trustee's deed
shall convey all of the right, title, and interest in the real and personal property sold at the
trustee's sale which the grantor had or had the power to convey at the time of the execution of
the deed of trust, and such as the grantor may have thereafter acquired. Except as provided in
subsection (2) of this section, if the trustee accepts a bid, then the trustee's sale is final as of the
date and time of such acceptance if the trustee's deed is recorded within fifteen days thereafter.
After a trustee's sale, no person shall have any right, by statute or otherwise, to redeem the

property sold at the trustee's sale.” (Emphasis added.)
