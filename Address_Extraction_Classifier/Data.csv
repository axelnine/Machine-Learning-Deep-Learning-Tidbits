"<sentence id=""s477"">Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame .",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s478"">In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is ""an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public"": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154].",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s479"">Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s480"">105 In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s481"">Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s482"">And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s483"">Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn).",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s484"">106 Did the Myer-Patching communications, as I am assuming them to be, give such a different complexion to the relationship of AFP officers with Scott Rush and/or with the other applicants as to establish an arguable case that a duty such as is proposed by the applicants was owed to him or to them?",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s485"">In my view they did not.",Sentence
This is notice of a lawsuit to evict you from the property which you are renting. Your,Sentence

mailing or facsimile to the address or facsimile number stated below TO BE RECEIVED NO,Sentence
LATER THAN THE DEADLINE STATED ABOVE. Service by facsimile is complete upon,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s486"">107 First, it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function, i.e.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s487"">the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s488"">The particular subject of the inquiry --- transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking - fell within areas of ""special emphasis"" in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s489"">As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals, the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of (inter alia) the applicants.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s490"">That letter indicated the AFP's purpose in making its request was that ""[t]he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers (other than CHAN) in Australia"".",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s491"">In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s492"">If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care, this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [147].",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s493"">108 Secondly, there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s494"">109 The Myer-Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush, not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s495"">I assume for the purposes of this application, that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s496"">I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s497"">However, it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s498"">Rather it appears to be said that, having regard (a) to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush, and (b) the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush's departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given, the AFP's failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s499"">Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s500"">110 It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s501"">I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s502"">My reasoning in that case is ""equally applicable to the Northern Territory"": ALRC Report 92, The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth, 652 (2001).",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s503"">111 The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information, i.e.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s504"">Lee Rush, but to the subject of it, i.e.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s505"">Scott Rush.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s506"">Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s507"">It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s508"">Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s509"">112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s510"">The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct: cf Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 esp at 456.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s511"">And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information, the effect of which would have been to obstruct the administration of the criminal law: A v Hayden [1984] HCA 67 ; (1984) 156 CLR 532.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s512"">113 Recasting the matter in terms of a duty of care owed to Scott Rush does not advance the matter.",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s50"">13 Lee Rush contacted a barrister and family friend, Robert Myers, to seek advice.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s51"">Myers had acted for Scott Rush on a number of minor criminal prosecutions concerned, in the main, with dishonesty offences.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s52"">Myers in turn contacted a friend of his, Damon Patching, a member of the Queensland Police Service who was at the relevant time seconded to the AFP.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s53"">Before referring to the evidence of Mr Myers and Mr Patching, I foreshadow that there are important differences between each's account of their several conversations particularly in relation to what Mr Patching is alleged to have said would be done, and had subsequently been done, by the AFP at Sydney Airport in relation to Scott Rush.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s54"">14 Myers' evidence is that he requested that Rush be detained at Sydney airport and prevented from leaving Australia.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s55"">He referred to Rush's prior convictions.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s56"">It was the case that Rush was on bail at the time.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s57"">Myers went on that if the AFP could not detain Rush he should be stopped at his point of exit and be advised that the AFP were aware he was ""up to no good"", that he would be watched in Bali and that it would be foolish for him to participate in illegal activity there.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s58"">15 Patching, according to Myers, said the AFP would talk to Rush if a passport alert (""a PACE alert"") was activated.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s59"">He was later told by Patching that this had occurred and that Rush had been spoken to at the airport.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s60"">Myers then spoke to Lee Rush and told him that, given what the AFP had done, he and Lee Rush had done all they could conceivably do and there was no necessity for Lee Rush to go to Bali to stop Scott.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s61"">16 Lee Rush's evidence of his conversations with Myers corroborated Myers' accounts and it was because of those conversations that he desisted from going immediately to Bali to stop his son committing any offence.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s62"">17 Mr Patching's evidence was that in one of his conversations with Myers he indicated he would contact Ashley Durre, another Queensland Police Service Officer on secondment with the AFP.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s63"">It was agreed with Durre that Patching should arrange for a PACE alert to be placed on Scott Rush.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s64"">Patching contacted Federal Agent Osseily who handled PACE alert matters at Sydney Airport, who activated the alert.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s65"">Osseily, Patching said, informed him he did not think ""it was a goer"" for the AFP to approach Scott and to warn him he was of interest to the police.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s66"">Patching said he knew at the time it would be unusual for police to make such an approach.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s67"">When he later rang Robert Myers and was asked whether Scott Rush would be approached and spoken to by the police, Patching deposed he said that ""may be looked at as a possibility ... depending on the circumstances"".",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s68"">He denied he gave any assurance that Rush would be approached.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s69"">The next day Patching received a call from Federal Agent Collins at Sydney Airport.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s70"">Collins asked him whether Rush's bail conditions would prevent him leaving the country.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">After enquiries in Queensland, Patching informed Collins they would not.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">He also told Collins that Lee Rush wanted Scott to be approached.",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s74"">Patching denied he gave Myers an assurance or undertaking at any stage that Scott Rush would be approached.",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s77"">It is maintained by the Australian Customs Service.",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s80"">He derived this information from Patching.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s81"">21 Mr Collins, who was on duty at the AFP office at Sydney Airport on 8 April, gave evidence that he was informed that morning of the alert on Scott Rush and that the basis of it was that Rush's bail conditions stipulated he was not allowed to depart Australia.",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s25"">The Tribunal reviewed those decisions under s 273GA(2) of the Customs Act .",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s26"">In respect of one further entry, the respondent applied for a refund of duty which it had paid under protest.",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">The Tribunal reviewed Customs' decision to refuse this refund application pursuant to s 273GA(1)(haaa).",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">All of the decisions under review were made on the basis that the products should be classified under sub-heading 3808.10.90 of Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act .",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s66"">It exhibits an extract from the annual report to 30 June 2004 of the respondent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s67"">That discloses a total equity on a consolidated basis of $856 556 000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s68"">The submissions for the applicant state (with no objection being taken to the statement) that for the financial year ended 30 June 2004, the applicant made an after-tax loss of $374 000 and had net assets of $286 000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s69"">31 I do not agree with the submission for the respondent that the different financial position of the parties is not a relevant issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s70"">It is part of the factual matrix and there is every reason why account should be taken of it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">There is no evidence of the applicant's current financial position and counsel for the respondent has indicated that questions may arise as to the applicant's capacity to meet its costs if the applicant was unsuccessful.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">32 In my view the financial difference between the two companies is a significant matter to be taken into account.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s73"">It weighs in favour of the applicant's opposition to the transfer, although it may not necessarily always be so in other circumstances.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s74"">If, for example, the applicant continued with its present solicitors and selected counsel acting for it, the additional costs may not necessarily be much greater than those which the applicant would face if the litigation continued in the Queensland District Registry.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s102"">Ground three asserts that his Honour either failed to find whether the appellants understood the correct position concerning the turnover after the Meeting or to give adequate reasons for any implicit finding to that effect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">28 The appellants' case was that both appellants were at the Meeting when Mr Ross confirmed the turnover of approximately $4000 per week.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">His Honour found that at the time of Mr Featherston presenting the correcting information to Mr Hinds, Mrs Hinds was elsewhere engaged in the room.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">His Honour then stated at [94(f)] that he did not exclude the possibility that Mr Hinds failed to tell his wife about the true effect of the figures shown to him by Mr Ross at the Meeting.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">He also stated that little turned on the issue and went on to say that he had found Mr Ross dealt with Mr Hinds and accurately disclosed the relevant figures to him.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">29 The appellants contend the issue was whether what occurred at the Meeting removed the misleading effect of the earlier misrepresentation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s108"">The submission is made that even if Mr Hinds knew the true position (which is disputed) his knowledge would not be imputed to Mrs Hinds: McMahon v Pomeray Pty Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-125 at 52,859; Collier v Electrum Acceptance Pty Ltd (1986) 66 ALR 613; C Lockhart, The Law of Misleading or Deceptive Conduct , 2 nd edn, LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia, 2003 at [10.20].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s109"">30 The second respondent submits that in the absence of a positive finding by his Honour that Mr Hinds did not advise Mrs Hinds of the corrected figures on turnover, his knowledge could be imputed to Mrs Hinds as joint purchaser of the business.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">31 The Meeting occurred on 8 January 2004.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">The Sale Agreement was executed in writing by the appellants on 10 January 2004.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">In it the appellants covenanted to purchase the business: no words of severance were used, so that their purchase was as joint tenants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">32 The Sale Agreement did not expressly refer to the appellants intending to conduct the business as a partnership.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">Section 7 of the Partnership Act 1895 (WA) provides that a partnership arises where there is a relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">Section 23 provides that notice to any partner who habitually acts in the partnership business of any matter relating to partnership affairs operates as notice to the firm, except in the case of a fraud on the firm committed by or with the consent of that partner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">Collier is authority that where the notice is given prior to the formal constitution of the partnership, it may not operate as notice to all partners.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">33 As stated above his Honour found that little turned on the issue of whether Mr Hinds had failed to tell his wife about the true effect of the figures shown to him by Mr Ross at the Meeting.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">This was because Mr Ross dealt with Mr Hinds to whom he had accurately disclosed the relevant figures.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">34 Even if his Honour implicitly and incorrectly reasoned that notice to Mr Hinds constituted notice to Mrs Hinds, he was not in error in reaching the view at [94(f)] that little turned on the issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">This is because his ultimate findings were to the effect that the appellants did not rely upon any of the representations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">Depending on how his Honour's words in the subparagraph are to be understood the ground is therefore either not made out or, if made out, cannot support the orders sought on the appeal.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s268"">The accounts show that the debt arose over the period from August 2002 to March 2003.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s269"">In his oral evidence, Scott asserted that he had made an arrangement with Missen of MBA in December 2002 and January 2003 to the effect that MBA would wait three to four months for payment of the debt.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s270"">81 It is difficult to reconcile this assertion with other evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s271"">In their respective reports as to the affairs of TSIA, both Scott and Fairbank said that TSIA owed a debt of $11,728.00 to MBA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s272"">There was no mention that a payment arrangement had been entered into in respect of this debt.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s273"">There is no written record of the payment arrangement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s274"">In addition, Fairbank answered the liquidator's questionnaire in relation to the affairs of TSIA by saying that MBA had pressed for payment of its debt for months.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s275"">I do not accept that any payment arrangement was made with MBA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s276"">82 It will be apparent from the foregoing that I reject the evidence given by Scott and Fairbank concerning these payment arrangements as self-serving and untruthful.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s277"">I infer that they did not raise these claims concerning payment arrangements earlier because they were incapable of being supported by admissible evidence and would not withstand investigation if prior notice were to be given.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s278"">83 In any event, even if I were to have regard to the payment arrangements asserted by Scott and Fairbank in respect of one or more of the creditors in question, it would not alter my conclusions as to the insolvency of TSI and TSIA throughout the six month relation back period.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s279"">There were other debts which were not paid by each company as and when they fell due during the relation back period.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s280"">Further, given these other debts, the claim that various payment arrangements were entered into with creditors serves to underlie the fact that the company did not have the financial capacity to meet its debts as and when they fell due during the relation back period.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s331"">Scott deposed that in total Swift Malaysia provided approximately $861,544.00 to TSI and TSIA, of which $461,500.00 approximately was provided under the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s332"">Scott also said that, until 13 May 2003, whenever he made a request for payment of any liability of either TSI and TSIA, those payments were made by Swift Malaysia and he had no reason to expect that those payments would not continue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s333"">According to Scott, the position changed on 13 May 2003 when Bayoud told him that Swift Malaysia was no longer able to provide financial support to TSI and TSIA in accordance with the terms of the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s334"">89 In his oral evidence, Scott confirmed that the arrangements with Swift Malaysia were embodied in the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s335"">However, he also made a series of far-reaching assertions about the effect of the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s336"">In his evidence in chief, he asserted that the July agreement contained an undertaking by Swift Malaysia to pay the then known liabilities of TSI and TSIA as and when they arose.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s337"">He then elaborated that the agreement was that Swift Malaysia would pay any and all debts as they arose from the time of entering that agreement and onwards.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s338"">Later in his evidence, Scott said that the undertaking by Swift Malaysia to be responsible for the liabilities of TSI and TSIA was the quid pro quo for the transfer of the shares in TSI and TSIA from TSI Inc to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s339"">The shares in TSI and TSIA were never transferred by TSI Inc to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s340"">When asked why would Swift Malaysia go on paying liabilities of TSI and TSIA when there was no performance of the corresponding obligation of TSI Inc to transfer shares to Swift Malaysia, Scott said that it was the arrangement that had been entered into and Swift was receiving the benefit of the output of the services of TSI for its own purposes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s341"">90 In his affidavit sworn 10 March 2006, Fairbank also said that the agreement with Swift Malaysia was embodied in the July agreement and that, of the $861,544.00 provided by Swift Malaysia to TSI and TSIA, the sum $461,554.00 was provided pursuant to the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s342"">In his oral evidence and in submissions, Fairbank made similar assertions to Scott as to the effect of the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s343"">91 The July agreement was an agreement between Swift Malaysia and TSI Inc; neither TSI nor TSIA was a party to it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s344"">The crux of the agreement was that Swift Malaysia agreed to purchase, and TSI Inc agreed to sell, all of its shares in TSI and TSIA, subject to the provisions of the agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s345"">In consideration of the sale of those shares, Swift Malaysia agreed to take over and be responsible for the liabilities of TSI and TSIA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s346"">The plain and natural meaning of these provisions is that Swift Australia was agreeing to take over and assume responsibility for the then known liabilities of TSI and TSIA as they stood at the date of sale.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s347"">As set out in paragraph 2 of the letter, Swift Australia wished to verify the amount of those liabilities by reference to up to date and accurate financial statements for the companies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s348"">This was not entirely agreed by paragraph 2 of the clarifications: words were added providing that, as an alternative to up to date financial statements, Swift Malaysia would be given full access to all of the financial records of the companies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s349"">92 In critical respects, the July agreement was never performed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s350"">TSI Inc did not transfer any shares in TSI or TSIA to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s351"">Swift Malaysia was not provided either in July 2002 or at any time thereafter with up to date financial statements for TSI or TSIA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s352"">The existing board members of TSI and TSIA did not resign, and Swift Malaysia did not have its nominated directors appointed to TSI or TSIA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s353"">Although the activities of TSI and TSIA were reduced after July 2002, there is no evidence that the ongoing operations of those two companies were put into hibernation to the extent contemplated by paragraph 4 of the letter.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s354"">There is no evidence of any business plan for the hibernation phase, or any proposed model to relaunch the retail product, being provided to Swift Malaysia within two weeks of 17 July 2002 or at all.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s355"">93 I do not accept that the July agreement had the far-reaching effect asserted by Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s356"">Specifically, I do not accept that the July agreement contained any undertaking or promise by Swift Malaysia to pay the on-going liabilities of TSI and TSIA, regardless of the lack of performance of the other conditions set out in the agreement, including the transfer of the shares in TSI and TSIA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s357"">94 The evidence establishes that Swift Malaysia provided substantial advances from time to time to assist TSI and TSIA to meet pressing liabilities.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s358"">I am satisfied that these were ad hoc loan arrangements between related companies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s359"">The funds provided by Swift Malaysia were recorded in the books of account of TSI and TSIA as loan funds.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s360"">In his evidence, Scott said that the payments made by Swift Malaysia to TSI and TSIA were recorded as loans on the basis that the loans were to be repaid after research and development activities had been completed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s361"">This is not consistent with the proposition that the funds were provided as a matter of obligation under the terms of the July agreement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s362"">The funds were not provided by Swift Malaysia pursuant to any legally binding commitment enshrined in the July agreement or otherwise.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s363"">95 I have given careful consideration to the evidence given by Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s364"">I carefully observed their demeanour when they were giving evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s365"">In my opinion, neither Scott nor Fairbank was a reliable or truthful witness.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s366"">In the absence of corroborating evidence, I am not prepared to act on their assertions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s367"">In particular, I reject their evidence that Swift Malaysia was bound by the July agreement to provide funds to TSI and TSIA to enable those companies to discharge their liabilities as and when they arose.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s368"">I am satisfied that Swift Malaysia never undertook any such obligation and, moreover, that it did not perform such an obligation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s369"">96 I am also satisfied that the funds actually advanced by Swift Malaysia directly, or via Swift Australia, to TSI and TSIA were not sufficient to enable either TSI or TSIA to pay their debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s370"">On the contrary, there is clear evidence that TSI and TSIA never had sufficient funds, whether from Swift Malaysia or elsewhere, to pay all of their debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s371"">It does not avail the directors to say that they used funds provided by Swift Malaysia to pay some of the larger and more pressing debts of TSI and TSIA, especially those, such as the debt to the Commissioner, which might expose the directors to personal liability.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s372"">As Kirby P said in FAI Insurances Limited v Gold Leaf Interior Decorators Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 643 at 649, a company's failure to pay a small debt may often be the best possible evidence of the company's insolvency.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s373"">97 Given my factual findings, the decision in Lewis does not assist the directors.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s374"">In any event, that was a very different case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s375"">There, a corporate reconstruction had resulted in a number of intercompany loans.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s376"">Following the reconstruction, over a period of slightly more than three years, the company paid all of its debts as and when they fell due with the assistance of funds provided by other companies in the group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s377"">Over that period, there was no evidence of any of the usual indicia of insolvency, such as unpaid group tax or payroll tax or other unpaid debts.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s378"">Most importantly, the funds provided by other group companies were sufficient at all relevant times to enable the company to discharge its debts as and when they fell due: see at 570-573 [74]-[82].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s379"">The present case is very different, in that the related company was never providing sufficient funds to enable TSI and TSIA to pay their respective debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s381"">In the second proceeding concerning TSIA, the liquidator alleges that six payments, totalling $66,827.05, were unfair preferences.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s382"">99 To establish these contentions, the liquidator must establish three things: (1) the payments were transactions; (2) the Commissioner received the payments in his capacity as a creditor; and (3) each payment resulted in the Commissioner receiving in respect of an unsecured debt more than he would receive if he proved for that debt in the winding up.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s383"">100 There was no dispute as to the last requirement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s384"">The liquidator gave evidence that he did not expect to make any payment to unsecured creditors in either liquidation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s385"">Consequently, by receiving and retaining the benefit of the payments identified by the liquidator, the Commissioner would, in the words of the statutory test, receive from the company in respect of the debt 'more than the creditor would receive from the company in respect of the debt if the transaction were set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s386"">101 In my opinion, each relevant payment was a transaction within the meaning of s 9 of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s387"">In the first proceeding, TSI was a party to each payment made to the Commissioner; the payment was either made pursuant to a garnishee order on TSI's bank account or, in one case, by TSI paying an amount to the Commissioner by a cheque drawn on its bank account.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s388"">In the second proceeding, each alleged unfair preference payment was made by TSIA by cheque drawn on its bank account.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s389"">102 The basis upon which Scott and Fairbank contended that the payments were not transactions was utterly misconceived.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s390"">They argued that many of the payments were made directly by Swift Malaysia, or at least using monies that had been provided by Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s391"">Alternatively, it was put that the payments were really made by or on behalf of the employees from whose wages tax deductions had been made.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s392"">In fact, none of the relevant payments now in issue were made directly by Swift Malaysia or Swift Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s393"">It is irrelevant to the definition of transaction in s 9 that the company in question may have used funds borrowed from Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s394"">The argument that the payments were really made by or on behalf of employees fails to take account of the relevant legislative provisions: see Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), ss 255 -1 and 255 -5; and Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), s 2(2) and s 3AA and Sch 1 (especially ss 12 -35, 12 -45, 16 - 5 , 16 -25, 16 -70, 16 -75 and 16 -80).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s395"">Broadly stated, the effect of these provisions is that a company is legally obliged to withhold amounts from wages on account of income tax, the amounts withheld must be paid to the Commissioner, and the amounts withheld constitute a debt that is due and payable by the company to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s396"">103 In each proceeding, the impugned payments constitute transactions within the meaning of s 9 , and the amounts in question were received by the Commissioner in its capacity as a creditor of the relevant company.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s397"">104 I have already found that all of the relevant payments were made at a time when TSI or TSIA (as the case may be) was insolvent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s398"">Accordingly, each unfair preference payment was also an insolvent transaction within the meaning of s 588FC.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s493"">Both the liquidator and the Commissioner argue that the settlement was reached at a mediation in which Scott and Fairbank participated and, but for the unsuccessful arguments raised by Scott and Fairbank in this proceeding, final orders could have been made disposing of the whole proceeding on 14 November 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s494"">131 While I consider that the liquidator is entitled to recover costs from Scott and Fairbank, it would be too harsh to run the calculations from 14 November 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s495"">The more appropriate date from which to calculate costs is 13 December 2005, being the date upon which Finkelstein J made directions for the contested hearing of these two proceedings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s496"">Aside from the settlement agreement between the liquidator and the Commissioner, the liquidator would have been entitled to recover interest from the Commissioner in each proceeding pursuant to s 51A(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s497"">In the ordinary course, interest would relate to the period from the date of demand by the liquidator for the repayment of the preferences until the date upon which such preferences were repaid: Ferrier v Civil Aviation Authority (1994) 55 FCR 28 at 92-93.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s498"">In these proceedings, however, the liquidator did not advance any claim for the recovery of interest from the Commissioner, save and to the extent that the orders proposed in the first proceeding include an agreed amount of $16,865.33 in respect of interest and costs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s499"">The liquidator has not advanced any cause of action against Scott and Fairbank that would entitle him to recover interest directly from them.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s500"">Furthermore, the Commissioner has not made any claim for the recovery of interest from Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s501"">The Commissioner's only entitlement against Scott and Fairbank is for an indemnity under s 588FGA and as the Commissioner is not exposed to any liability for interest in respect of the period after 14 November 2005, there is no basis for claiming interest against Scott and Fairbank in respect of that period.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s502"">In my opinion, it is not appropriate to order that Scott and Fairbank make any payment of interest to the liquidator.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s503"">132 As for the order that Scott and Fairbank pay $46,126.15 to the Commissioner, the figure has two components.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s504"">The first component represents that part of the total payments of $38,319.55 that reflects the payment of ITW liabilities, namely $29,260.82.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s505"">The second component represents the sum agreed between the Commissioner and the liquidator for interest and costs of $16,865.33.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s506"">In my opinion, the second component is excessive.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s507"">As I have explained, it needs to be reduced to take account of the fact that ITW liabilities represented only 76.36 per cent of the total figure of $38,319.55.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s508"">Applying this percentage produces a figure of $12,878.37 for interest and costs, which I consider to be the appropriate measure of the Commissioner's loss and damage in this respect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s509"">133 It follows that the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3) above must be adjusted by substituting the amount of $42,139.19 for the sum of $46,126.15 proposed by the Commissioner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s510"">134 I consider that Scott and Fairbank should be ordered to pay the Commissioner's costs of and incidental to the cross-claim.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s511"">135 Some adjustments must also be made to the orders which the liquidator and the Commissioner seek in the second proceeding.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s13"">5 ASIC drew attention to two possible questions beyond the issue raised which might cast doubt upon making of the direction as sought.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s14"">The first is whether sufficient information was provided to creditors concerning the basis upon which the remuneration was calculated in the case of resolution 1.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s15"">The second is whether a resolution purporting to fix the remuneration, inter alia, of partners and staff of an administrator, relevantly deals with the remuneration of the administrator for the purposes of s 449E in the case of resolutions 1 and 2.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s16"">I shall return to the procedural question having considered the substance of the matter at issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">The first meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 436E of the Act on 27 June 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">The second meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 439A of the Act on 15 July 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">At that meeting, the creditors resolved that the company should execute a DOCA with Gidley as the deed administrator.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s31"">12 At the meeting of 15 July 2005, the creditors passed three resolutions that related to remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s32"">The first two resolutions related to the remuneration of the administrators of Aliance and the last resolution related to the remuneration of the administrator of the DOCA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s33"">The resolutions were as follows (numbered for ease of reference):",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s49"">It could be ""fixed"" as a periodic salary, a lump sum, a percentage of some amount (such as the value of the company's assets under the administrators' control) or according to the amount of time spent by the administrator determined by reference to a scale or formula.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s50"">The matter is simply left at large.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s51"">So also is the basis upon which the quantum of the remuneration is to be determined.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s52"">That is, the section is silent on the factors to be taken into account both for deciding the appropriate method of ""fixing"" an administrator's remuneration and in determining the amount to be ""fixed"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s53"">The only guidance that is given, and it is given by necessary implication, is that an administrator is entitled to reasonable remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s54"">That offers little assistance to the tribunal that is required to decide what is reasonable in a particular case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s64"">On one view such approval does no more than fix the rate at which remuneration is to be charged; as the method sets no limit to the amount to be charged it may not ""fix"" the remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s65"">At least there must be real doubt about the validity of the practice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s66"">It is not, however, a matter which I need resolve, for the issue does not arise squarely on the facts and no submissions were directed to the question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s67"">To reach a concluded view would require consideration of, among other things, the knowledge of the practice by Parliament when the Companies Acts were re-enacted or amended.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s68"">If Parliament knew of the practice and did not change the statute that is relevant to its interpretation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s69"">I should say that if the practice be irregular that would not mean that a liquidator must complete his administration before he receives any remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s70"">He could be allowed interim remuneration while work is being performed, leaving the precise amount of his remuneration to be fixed when the winding up is complete.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">In any event, the problem may not be as large as at first it seems.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">Oftentimes, especially in a complex administration, it will be too difficult to fix fees prospectively having regard to the matters that should be taken into account, as I will later explain.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s73"">For this reason courts have from time to time refused to fix fees prospectively: for instance Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s74""> Be that as it may, whatever be the correct meaning of ""fixing"" remuneration, it was not ""fixed"" in this case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s75"">The resolutions purporting to fix the administrators' remuneration did so by reference to the rates in the administrators' report.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s76"">According to those rates work performed by persons occupying the same position could attract a different hourly charge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s77"">There was no criteria by reference to which one could determine which hourly charge would be applied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s78"">In reality it was left to the administrators to decide what the rate would be.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s79"">In this state of affairs it was the administrators and not the creditors who fixed their remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s83"">That passage is consistent with a series of other decisions concerning the wartime regulations, decided at about the same time, including Vardon v Commonwealth [1943] HCA 30 ; (1943) 67 CLR 434; Cann's Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210; and King Gee Clothing Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s84"">20 It is submitted for the plaintiff that the resolutions in the present case do not suffer from the defect which existed in Stockford as there is only one rate fixed for each person who does any work in connection with the administration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s85"">Once the person and his or her category is known, and the time spent is known, the guide can be arithmetically applied to arrive at the result.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s86"">Thus, the resolution here does avoid one of the problems which brought down the arrangement in Stockford .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s87"">Counsel also relied upon the specific monetary limits or caps to avoid the criticism that the arrangements would otherwise be open ended.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">21 It is submitted for ASIC, however, that whilst this formula may have the appearance of objectivity and certainty, that appearance is misleading.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s89"">It is submitted that the charge out rates cannot be applied until various issues involving a considerable degree of subjectivity, assessment, discretionary allocation or apportionment have been determined.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s90"">It is submitted that these subjective elements include assessing which tasks should be claimed for, apportioning the time taken on tasks that relate to more than just the particular administration in question, allocating the tasks to staff with the appropriate level of seniority, and assessing the actual number of hours to be claimed in respect of each task and of each member of staff having regard to such matters as, for example, work redone as a result of mistake or carelessness, the efficiency or inefficiency of the staff member, the quality of the work and so on.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s91"">It is submitted that these discretionary elements mean that, in effect, the actual fixing of the amount is left to the administrators rather than to the creditors or to the Court as provided for by the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s92"">This is said to be an impermissible delegation of power ( Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50 ; (1979) 142 CLR 460 at 481).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s93"">It is submitted that all that is fixed is a rate for certain tasks rather than remuneration for the work done or to be done.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s94"">22 ASIC pointed to the potential for abuse if the plaintiff's construction were adopted, bearing in mind that creditors may not be sufficiently well informed or have sufficient funds to properly scrutinise what was proposed or to bring the matter to the Court pursuant to s 449E(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">It was also submitted that there are traditional methods of fixing remuneration other than by way of lump sum or time charging, for example, by way of a percentage of the value of assets dealt with.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">Counsel for ASIC also did not accept that, generally speaking, remuneration could or should be fixed prospectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">23 It is submitted for ASIC that, according to the plaintiff's construction, the power to 'fix' remuneration is conferred in general terms and applies whether or not the administrator has performed all or any of the services for which he or she is to be remunerated.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">In other words, remuneration may be both retrospective and prospective.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">There is nothing to suggest that 'fix' will have a different meaning when considering prospective remuneration as opposed to retrospective remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s100"">It is submitted that it would be insufficient when fixing retrospective remuneration on a time basis for decision making bodies simply to be given the hourly charge out rate for approval.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s101"">More would be required.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s102"">This should also be the case in fixing prospective remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">It is also submitted that, as a court has the power to 'fix' fees, it is to be assumed that the Court would require similar information.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">As this cannot be given in relation to prospective fixing, it follows that an hourly rate basis is inappropriate for all relevant purposes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">24 It is submitted on behalf of ASIC that the relevant extrinsic material does not support the plaintiff's proposition.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">The Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992 referred to the 1988 Law Reform Commission Report known as the 'Harmer Report' ( General Insolvency Inquiry , Australian Law Reform Commission, Report No 45 (1988) (Harmer Report) which, it is submitted, effectively rejected the approach contended for as follows:",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">25 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, as s 449E contemplates that remuneration may be fixed before all (or perhaps any) work is done either in the administration or under the DOCA, there would be serious practical problems if the view contended for by ASIC were adopted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">It is most unlikely that the intended consequence of the legislation was that prospective remuneration could only be fixed by way of a specific monetary amount.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">The size and complexity of administrations vary so much that the precise work to be undertaken may not be capable of reliable estimation in advance.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">It may thus not be practicable to agree on a fixed amount.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">There would also be a tendency to 'load' the amount because of risk.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">If fees could only be fixed retrospectively, the administrator would be at risk as to his or her remuneration during the period when the work is required to be performed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">Further, additional meetings of creditors would be required, with consequent expense.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">26 It was also submitted for the plaintiff that the extrinsic material did not support ASIC's position and that the extract taken from the Harmer Report above (para [24]), referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992, in particular did not assist in deciding the present controversy as there is no sufficient connection between the recommendations of the Harmer Report, on the one hand, and the legislation as drafted some years later, on the other, to make the passage relied upon by ASIC a safe guide to construction of the section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">27 Counsel for ASIC responded to the argument based upon practical inconvenience by suggesting that interim payments could be authorised, as suggested by Finkelstein J in Stockford (at [30]) or that a certain monetary sum could be fixed on the basis that the administrator should have the right to seek further remuneration at a later meeting (cf Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">(See also Re Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement); Korda (as joint and several deed administrators of Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement v The J Aron Corporation (2005) 53 ACSR 432; (2005) 23 ACLC 710; [2005] FCA 543.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">) ASIC suggested that the convenience of avoiding additional meetings be given little, if any, weight.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">It would follow that the remuneration of an administrator of a company under administration would normally be fixed substantially retrospectively, having in mind the timing and purpose of a s 439A meeting, but that of the administrator of a DOCA could be fixed prospectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">In the normal case, the deed might well include a clause relating to remuneration (as in this case) and there might also be a separate resolution in relation to remuneration at the meeting pursuant to s 439A which resolves to execute the deed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">Furthermore, there is no restriction as to when a s 445F meeting should take place.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">There will often be an expectation that a deed of company arrangement will be administered for a reasonably lengthy period of time although the same may not be true of the administration of a company, with some notable exceptions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">It follows that s 449E contemplates the fixing of remuneration prospectively, at least in many cases.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">29 In my opinion, there is no escape from the conclusion that, if remuneration is to be fixed prospectively, it may be fixed by reference to a formula based upon time, provided that the formula is objective enough to satisfy the tests laid down by the High Court in the wartime line of authority to which reference has been made.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">That is the ordinary and natural meaning of the provision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">I see no warrant for departing from this meaning because of the extrinsic material which is equivocal at best.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">30 I appreciate the force of the concern expressed on behalf of ASIC as to the potential for abuse in relation to time charging which echoes concerns expressed by Finkelstein J and other judges.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">That is not a reason for precluding it as a method of remuneration in an age where it has become ubiquitous in relation to the provision of professional services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">Parliament has provided the necessary safeguards.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">The first safeguard is that remuneration may only be fixed by a resolution of the company's creditors or by the Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">It may not be fixed by the administrator.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">The second safeguard is that there is a full review by the Court available on the application of any officer, member or creditor of the company.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">In my opinion, those safeguards ought to be allowed to operate without artificially constraining the concept of 'fixing' of remuneration by means of unexpressed implications.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">I should add that doubts expressed as to the application of s 449E have led to the utilisation of the extraordinary provisions of s 447A on many occasions to cure perceived problems including the authorisation of interim payments.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">In my opinion, Parliament would not have intended that this should be necessary.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">31 The resolutions in question in this case are capable of objective application.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">All of the necessary elements can be objectively identified.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">The person doing the work, that person's category and the period spent are all the elements required.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">The sum can be calculated or ascertained definitely.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">If that produces an unreasonable result by reason of the factors referred to by counsel for ASIC, or otherwise, then the remedy is an application for review by the Court pursuant to s 449E(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">I do not agree that the effect of the resolutions here is to enable the plaintiff to fix the remuneration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">I should add that, in my opinion, the provision for a cap is not relevant to deciding whether or not remuneration has been 'fixed'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">At the time the resolution was passed, there was no certainty that the cap would be reached.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s147"">Therefore, it is not a sum certain.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">A cap may, however, be relevant to the question of reasonableness which would arise if there is a challenge by any officer, member or creditor of the company to the remuneration fixed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">32 I thus uphold the plaintiff's position on the critical issue concerning the proper construction of s 449E(1).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">As pointed out earlier, ASIC has pointed to two other issues which might be said to go to the validity of the resolutions in question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">I make no comment as to whether those issues would in truth go to validity as no officer, member or creditor of the company has raised either of them.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">Bearing in mind the limited nature and effect of giving a direction pursuant to s 447D, I propose to give the direction sought.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s153"">It will protect the plaintiff but does not bind others.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s154"">These reasons will make clear the limited basis upon which the direction is given.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">33 It is not appropriate to make any order for the costs of this proceeding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">It has been brought in order to resolve a matter of general interest that has not been raised by any party interested in the particular company.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">The result is to the benefit of the plaintiff.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s6"">The warrant applications were made by members of the staff of the ACC to the second respondent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s7"">The ACC is a body established by s 7 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s8"">The second respondent is a Deputy Chamber Magistrate of the Local Court of New South Wales.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s9"">The second respondent did not appear at the hearing, no doubt because he intends to abide the result of the proceedings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s10"">4 The first warrant was issued to Roland Fleischer on 8 June 2005 as the executing officer in relation to the warrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s11"">Mr Fleischer is a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act and was so described in the warrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s12"">The warrant authorised the executing officer to enter and search residential premises occupied by the applicant and to seize, inter alia , evidential material relating to the commission of offences against s 29D of the Crimes Act , ss 134.2(1) and 400 (4) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Criminal Code Act"") and/or s 82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) (""the 1987 Proceeds of Crime Act "").</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s13"">After the warrant issued, the name of Brian John Healy and thereafter the name of Ren de Haas in his stead, each of whom is a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act , was written on the warrant as the executing officer in accordance with ss 3C(1) and 3E (5)(d) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s14"">5 The second warrant was issued on 8 June 2005 to Mr Fleischer as the executing officer.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s15"">Again, he was described in the warrant as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s16"">The warrant authorised the executing officer to enter and search certain business premises occupied by a group of companies of which the applicant was a director, and to seize evidential material relating to the commission of one or more of the offences that were mentioned in the first warrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s17"">After its issue, the name of Brian John Healy and thereafter the name of Grant Prosser, each of whom is a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act , was written on the warrant in accordance with ss 3C(1) and 3E (5)(d).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s18"">6 Both warrants were executed on 9 June 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s19"">Material was seized pursuant to the warrants, including material which was the property of the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s20"">7 Under s 7C of the ACC Act , the board of the ACC may determine in writing that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s21"">Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s22"">On 13 May 2003, the board of the ACC made a determination pursuant to this provision which was termed the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s23"">The special investigation extends to activities that may have involved the commission of offences against s 29D of the Crimes Act , ss 134.2(1) and 400 (4) of the Criminal Code Act, and s 82 of the 1987 Proceeds of Crime Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s24"">There is no challenge to the validity of this determination.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s25"">8 In its defence, the ACC explicitly admits that the warrant applications were made, and the warrants were executed, to assist with the ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s26"">9 For the sake of completeness, I should mention that the pleadings disclose one aspect of the facts where the applicant and the ACC adopt slightly different positions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">The applicant alleges that, while each person successively named in each warrant was both a constable and a member of the staff of the ACC, he was appointed as executing officer in his capacity as a member of the staff of the ACC.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">The ACC denies the latter part of this allegation, and pleads instead that each such person was appointed as executing officer in his capacity as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">Mr Graham QC, senior counsel for the applicant, referred to these different positions, but confirmed that he did not rely upon the applicant's allegation as a ground for invalidating the warrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">He added that the applicant's contention supported the proposition that the warrants were executed for the purposes of the ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s31"">Given the ACC's explicit admission that the warrants were executed for the sole purpose of assisting the ACC special investigation, I consider that this minor difference in factual allegations is immaterial to the issues which I must consider.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s53"">The ACC combined the functions of the National Crime Authority (""NCA""), the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s54"">The functions of the ACC include the collection of criminal information and intelligence, the undertaking of intelligence operations, and the investigation of federally relevant criminal activity: see s 7A of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s55"">19 The expression 'federally relevant criminal activity' is explained by several definitions in s 4 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s56"">In summary, it refers to any circumstances implying, or any allegations, that a serious and organised crime may have been, may be being, or may in future be committed so as to give rise to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, or a law of a State that has a federal aspect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s57"">20 The ACC does not itself have the power to institute criminal proceedings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s58"">Under s 12(1) , if the ACC obtains evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, being evidence that would be admissible in a prosecution for the offence, it must assemble the evidence and provide it to the relevant law officer, law enforcement agency or prosecuting authority.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s59"">21 Section 22 of the ACC Act deals with the issue of search warrants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s60"">For present purposes, the most pertinent sub-sections are (1), (5) and (10).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s61"">They provide:",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">For instance, s 3E requires that the issuing officer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material (as defined) at the premises to which the search warrant is to relate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">Different pre-conditions are found in s 22(1) of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s73"">The applicant for a warrant under s 22 must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a thing or things or a particular kind connected with a special ACC operation/investigation are at the specified premises and, in addition, the applicant must believe on reasonable grounds that if a summons were issued for the production of the thing or things they might be concealed, lost, mutilated or destroyed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s74"">It follows that a warrant could be obtained under s 22 in circumstances where none could be obtained under s 3E, and vice versa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s75"">But it does not follow that the mere fact that a warrant might be obtainable under s 22 precludes the issuance of a warrant under s 3E.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s76"">THE APPLICANT'S ARGUMENTS",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s77"">First, the applicant argues that s 22 is a code or regime that sets out the ACC's powers in respect of search warrants, and represents the only source of power to issue search warrants when they are sought for the purpose of assisting an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s78"">Second, the applicant argues that the purpose of search and seizure under s 3E of the Crimes Act is to obtain and preserve evidential material for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s79"">According to the applicant, this means that Pt 1AA does not confer power to issue a search warrant whose sole purpose is to assist an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s80"">In reality, these two arguments may be different dimensions of a single argument, namely that Pt 1AA should be read down by reference to s 22.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s81"">Be that as it may, I propose to deal with the two arguments separately.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s82"">REJECTION OF THE APPLICANT'S CASE",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s83"">27 In summary, I consider that there is no justification for reading down Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act by reference to s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s84"">The conditions and limitations in s 22 apply when an application is made for a search warrant under that section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s85"">But if a staff member of the ACC can satisfy an issuing officer of the conditions set out in s 3E of the Crimes Act , nominates a constable to execute the warrant, and otherwise complies with all of the requirements of Pt 1AA , there is no reason why a search warrant cannot issue under s 3E.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s86"">The fact that the sole reason for applying for a search warrant under s 3E may be to assist a special investigation that is being undertaken by the ACC does not render s 3E inapplicable.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s87"">Section 3E does not impose any limitation of that kind.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">Nor does it impose any limitation upon the persons who may apply for a warrant under it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s89"">28 Section 3D(2) puts the matter beyond doubt by making it plain that the search warrant power in s 3E may be used when Commonwealth offences are being investigated under another piece of Commonwealth legislation, notwithstanding the availability of a search warrant power under that other legislation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s90"">29 I now turn to a more detailed discussion of my reasons for rejecting the arguments advanced by the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s91"">THE ACC ACT DOES NOT LIMIT PART 1AA OF THE CRIMES ACT",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s92"">In effect, the applicant argues that s 22 is the only source of power to issue search warrants when they are sought for the purpose of assisting an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s93"">31 In my opinion, the argument is not sustainable.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s94"">In Ryder v Morley (1987) 16 FCR 257 ("" Ryder v Morley ""), the Full Court (Fox, Jenkinson and Wilcox JJ) rejected an identical argument in the context of s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">The case concerned a search warrant that was issued to a detective sergeant in the Australian Federal Police.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">He had been seconded to the NCA to assist it with a particular investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">The applicant argued that a search warrant that was to be executed for the purposes of the NCA investigation must be issued pursuant to, and subject to the restrictions of, the NCA Act , including in particular s 22 thereof, and that s 10 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor of s 3E) cannot be prayed in aid of the warrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">32 At trial in Ryder v Morley (1986) 12 FCR 438, Toohey J held that the attachment of the detective sergeant to the NCA did not deprive him of his status as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act , and nor did it deprive him of the right to seek the issue of a search warrant pursuant to s 10 of that Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">His Honour did not see anything to preclude recourse being had to s 10 of the Crimes Act , as he explained in the following passage at 441:",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s100"">Had a member of the Authority required a warrant for the purpose of a special function of the Authority, it was open to that member to apply to a judge of a prescribed court under s 22(1).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s101"">But the warrant was sought by a member of the Australian Federal Police who satisfied a justice of the peace, by information on oath, that a warrant was justified in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s102""> ""I agree with counsel for the respondents that the subsection simply means what it says and that there is no justification for reading it down.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">Counsel for the applicants argued that if a police officer seconded to the Authority could rely upon s 22(10) to justify the obtaining of a warrant under s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , the limitations in s 22 could be set at naught.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">But that is not so.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">The limitations in s 22 apply when the Authority relies upon a special investigation which it is conducting to obtain a search warrant in the terms of that section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">But if a constable can satisfy a justice of the peace, in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , that a search warrant is justified, the justice may issue a warrant under that section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about s 22(10) ; in my view the subsection is designed for the sort of situation that arose in the present case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">In my view, the supposed distinction is not made out.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">It is founded on a statement in the Full Court judgment that 'we do not know whether it was a ""special investigation"", which deals with a ""matter relating to"" a specified ""relevant criminal activity"", and is not confined to things used or believed to be intended to be used for the commission of a crime.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">' It is not clear whether the Full Court was saying that it did not know whether it was a special investigation at all, or whether it was saying that it did not know that the special investigation had the particular features it mentions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">However, it does not matter.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">The applicant's whole argument in Ryder v Morley invited the Court to assume that a search warrant could have been issued pursuant to s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">In other words, the argument invited the Court to assume that the search warrant in question had been sought in connection with a special investigation by the NCA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">The Court was well aware that the power conferred by s 22(1) of the NCA Act could only be exercised in connection with a special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">The thrust of the argument the Court was addressing was that, as s 22 was available, the legislative intention was that it should apply to the exclusion of s 10 of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">Both Toohey J and the Full Court addressed the merits of this argument on the assumption that s 22 was available and that its conditions could have been satisfied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">It follows that the observations made both by Toohey J and the Full Court concerning the relationship between s 22 of the NCA Act and s 10 of the Crimes Act were premised upon an assumption, favourable to the applicant in that case, that the warrant had been sought in order to advance a special investigation by the NCA and so could have been obtained under s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">35 For the foregoing reasons, I consider that Ryder v Morley is Full Court authority directly contrary to the argument that the applicant advances in this case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">Ryder v Morley was followed by Moore J in Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder [1997] FCA 1535 ("" Malubel) .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">One of the submissions made by the applicant in Malubel was to the effect that it was not open to the second respondent to make application under s 3E of the Crimes Act given the special provisions of s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">His Honour dismissed the application and in doing so he referred with approval to Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">Moore J's decision was upheld on appeal by the Full Court (Burchett, RD Nicholson and Madgwick JJ): see Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder (1998) 88 FCR 242.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">36 Since Ryder v Morley was decided, s 10 of the Crimes Act has been replaced by Pt 1AA , and there have been minor amendments to s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">However, s 22(10) is unchanged.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">In my opinion, none of these changes affects or in any way reduces the authority of Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">37 When the ACC Act was enacted in 2002, s 22(10) was left in the form in which it was considered in Ryder v Morley , notwithstanding the introduction of Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act in 1994 by the Crimes Amendment Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">Viewed against the background of Ryder v Morley and the introduction of s 3D(2) into Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act , the retention of s 22(10) in unchanged form affords an indication that Parliament intended that in appropriate cases police officers who had been seconded to the ACC to assist it with a special investigation could apply for search warrants under Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act , provided of course that the requirements of Pt 1AA could be satisfied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">38 The applicant also submitted that significant safeguards are incorporated in s 22 that are not found in Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">The most important of these was said to be that, under s 4 of the ACC Act , an issuing officer is defined to mean 'a Judge of the Federal Court, a Judge of a court of a State or Territory or a Federal Magistrate'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">It was said that, in contrast, the Crimes Act confers power to issue a search warrant upon a Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace and various court officials.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">Mr Robberds QC, senior counsel for the ACC, pointed out that essentially the same differences existed at the time that Ryder v Morley was decided: under s 22 of the NCA Act a search warrant application had to be made to a judge of a prescribed court, whereas the search warrant under challenge in Ryder v Morley had been issued by a Justice of the Peace.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">39 The applicant also submitted that sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) of s 22 contain further safeguards which have no direct equivalents in Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">Particular reference was made to the provisions of sub-section (5).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">40 The ACC submitted that the differences in safeguards between Pt 1AA and s 22 are marginal and no significant weight attaches to them in resolving the issues before the Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">I agree with these submissions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">In particular, when ss 22(1) , (3), (5) and (7) of the ACC Act are examined, it is apparent that a similar range of protections can be found in ss 3E(1) , (5) and (6)(a) and 3F (1)(c) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">41 Even if there were significant differences between the safeguards attending Pt 1AA and those attending s 22 , any such differences could be relevant only to an argument that Pt 1AA should be read down by reference to s 22.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">The argument that the Crimes Act should be read down so as to prevent the safeguards in s 22 being subverted was explicitly rejected by the Full Court in Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s147"">As will later appear, I also consider that any such reading down would be contrary to the plain language and intention of s 3D(2) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">PART 1AA AUTHORISES THE ISSUE OF THE WARRANTS",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">It is unclear whether this contention is put independently of the argument that the ACC Act contains its own code or special regime for the issue of any search warrants that are required for the purposes of a special ACC operation or investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">But, in any event, I have concluded that the contention is not supported by the language, context or purposes of Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">43 The applicant's contentions about the limited scope of Pt 1AA are built upon the proposition that the purpose of search and seizure under ss 3E and 3F is to obtain and preserve evidential material for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">In my view, this is too narrow a description of the functions and purposes of search warrants under Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s153"">44 The applicant relies on a statement by the responsible Minister in his second reading speech for the Crimes Amendment Bill that '[s]earch warrants will authorise the seizing of evidence of the offence to which the warrant relates as well as evidence of any other indictable offence': see Hansard, House of Representatives, 17 November 1993 at 3030.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s154"">As I read his speech, the Minister was simply describing in general terms certain uses to which a search warrant can be put.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">His statement does not support the limitation that the applicant seeks to imply into Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">45 More importantly, the limitation that the applicant would import into Pt 1AA is negated by the language of ss 3E and 3F.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">Section 3E authorises the issue of a search warrant where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or will be within 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises in question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">Amongst other things, s 3F authorises the officer executing the warrant to search for and seize evidential material of the kind specified in the warrant, other evidential material found at the premises that relates to the offences specified in the warrant or other unspecified offences that are indictable offences, other evidential material or tainted property as those terms are defined in the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act , or seizable items as defined in s 3C of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s159"">Section 338 of the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act defines 'evidential material' quite differently from the way in which it is defined in s 3C of the Crimes Act : it means evidence relating to property in respect of which action has been or could be taken under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act , benefits derived from the commission of an indictable offence, or literary proceeds (being benefits derived from exploiting a person's notoriety resulting from the commission of an indictable offence).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s160"">Broadly summarised, s 338 defines 'tainted property' to mean the proceeds of an indictable offence, or property that was used, or was intended to be used, in or in connection with an offence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s161"">46 The definition of 'evidential material' in s 3C does not support an implication that the material in question must be seized for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s162"">When read with the definitions of a thing relevant to an indictable offence or summary offence in s 3 , the definition extends to anything with respect to which an offence is reasonably suspected to have been committed, anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence, or anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s163"">47 On the face of these provisions, it is impossible to confine them to evidential material that is for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s164"">Material that assists the investigation of suspected offences, but which is incapable of being used in the criminal prosecution process, falls squarely within the definition of evidential material.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s165"">Material of this kind would constitute something with respect to which an indictable offence has been committed or is reasonably suspected to have been committed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s166"">The expression ""with respect to"" has a wide meaning: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 526-527 and 556; and as to the cognate phrase 'in respect of', see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Scully [2000] HCA 6 ; (2000) 201 CLR 148 at 171.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s167"">48 The definition of a 'thing relevant to an indictable offence' in s 3 refers to things that might 'afford evidence' as to the commission of an offence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s168"">This concept is not to be understood narrowly.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s169"">In Adler v Gardiner (2002) 43 ACSR 24 at 29, in a passage quoted with approval by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 at 543, Hely J rejected a submission that documents fell outside the scope of a warrant issued under s 3E because the documents could never be admitted into evidence at a trial in relation to the warrant offences.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s207"">When the relevant passages in the judgment of the Full Court are read as a whole, it is plain that the Full Court was not suggesting that information can only be gathered under a search warrant if it serves the dual purpose of both determining whether offences have been committed and facilitating proof of them in a criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s208"">Moreover, I do not consider that the Full Court was referring to proof in a criminal prosecution process, as distinct from proof in the broader context of a criminal investigation that may or may not result in a prosecution.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s209"">52 The limitation that the applicant seeks to import into Pt 1AA is inconsistent with other authorities.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s210"">In Harts Australia Ltd v Australian Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 153, the Full Court (Hill, Cooper and Whitlam JJ) recognised that search warrants can be sought and issued at an early stage of an investigation when it is unclear whether any criminal prosecution will occur.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s211"">In Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 at [55] - [58] , the Full Court (Dowsett, Jacobson and Greenwood JJ) approved the statements in Hart that I have extracted and added that statutes such as Pt 1AA should not be construed narrowly but consistently with the operational reality applicable to the issue and execution of warrants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s212"">53 In summary, I consider that the limitation that the applicant seeks to read into Pt 1AA has no basis in the language of Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s213"">Indeed, it conflicts with the text of both ss 3E and 3F .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s214"">It is, moreover, inconsistent with the operational reality applicable to the issue and execution of search warrants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s215"">As a matter of history, statutory construction and authority, I consider that a search warrant can be issued under Pt 1AA in order to advance a criminal investigation, whether or not any decision has been made about the likelihood of a prosecution, and whether or not the material sought by the warrant is intended to be used, or is capable of being used, in a criminal prosecution.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s216"">SECTION 3D(2)",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s217"">In my view, s 3D(2) is fatal to the applicant's argument.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s218"">Section 3D(2) expressly confirms that, despite the power conferred by s 22 of the ACC Act , members of the staff of the ACC may apply for warrants under Pt 1AA , provided that the requirements of s 3E are otherwise satisfied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s219"">This interpretation of s 3D is supported by the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum, as I have already mentioned.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s220"">55 The applicant asserted that s 3D(2) is of no assistance to the ACC in seeking to rely on Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s221"">This assertion rested entirely on the two contentions that I have already rejected, namely that s 22 is an exclusive code that precludes recourse to Pt 1AA , and that Pt 1AA does not confer any power to apply for, or to issue, a search warrant where the sole purpose of the warrant is to assist an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s222"">The latter contention was advanced by the applicant without addressing the meaning and effect of s 3D(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s223"">In that respect, the applicant's contention begs the question whether on the proper construction of Pt 1AA as a whole, including s 3D(2), it contains any limitation of the kind asserted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s224"">In my opinion, both for the reasons already given and because of the plain meaning and intended effect of s 3D, no such limitation can be imported into Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s225"">56 The applicant attempted to minimise the significance of s 3D(2) by describing it as a non-limitation provision which operated in a similar fashion to s 3D(1).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s226"">Section 3D(1) performs a different function from s 3D(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s227"">It confirms that Pt 1AA does not limit or exclude s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s228"">It is not directly relevant in this case because the ACC did not invoke any powers under s 22.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s229"">On the other hand, s 3D(2) declares that the search warrant powers under Pt 1AA may be used even if another law of the Commonwealth, such as s 22 of the ACC Act , provides for the issuance and execution of search warrants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s230"">In that way, as the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum stated, the purpose and effect of s 3D(2) is to remove any doubt that the search warrant powers under Pt 1AA may be used when Commonwealth offences are being investigated under other Commonwealth legislation, even if that other legislation contains search warrant powers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s231"">CONCLUSION",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s232"">In my view, the search warrants were validly issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s233"">There is no challenge to the way in which the search warrants were executed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s234"">58 The application is dismissed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s235"">59 I order that the applicant pay the first respondent's costs of the proceeding, including reserved costs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s236"">As to reserved costs, the parties informed me at the hearing that they agreed that all reserved costs should follow the event.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s237"">I do not propose to make any order for costs that affects the position of the second respondent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s238"">I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">The Attorney-General relied on affidavits dated 17 August 2005 an 7 February 2005 by a legal officer of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ('ASIO') whose name has not been revealed in open court for reasons set out in those affidavits.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">I direct under section 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the name of the officer or any material capable of identifying him not be disclosed without leave of a judge of the court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">11 The material in the affidavits provided by the unnamed officer includes redacted electronic copies of the submissions which were before the Attorney-General and noted by him on the occasions on which he came to consider the issue of the earlier certificate and the certificate the subject of these proceedings dated 19 April 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">13 In essence, the material that was put to the Attorney-General by the Director-General asserted that, without any challenge to Mr Hopper's integrity or willingness to abide by his obligations under his security classification, there was a real risk of inadvertent disclosure by him.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">Among other reasons given as to why that may happen was the fact that Mr Hopper not only acted for the present applicant but had acted in the past and continues to act at present for other persons who are of interest to Australia's security services and to whom inadvertent disclosure may be, in effect, meaningful.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">14 The argument before me has tended to centre on the provisions of section 39A subsections (8) and (9), particularly because it is in those provisions that some exception to the blanket effect of a certificate can be made if the Attorney-General is prepared to consent to a person representing an applicant before the Tribunal being present when evidence is adduced or submissions made that are the subject of the certificate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">However, each part of the statute must be construed separately, although the court will try to give an harmonious meaning to it as a whole: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at pp.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">381-382 [69]-[71] and 384 [78].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">15 Critically, each of the three empowering provisions authorises the Attorney-General to certify in writing that the disclosure of information concerning a specified matter or the disclosure of any matter contained in a document will be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the security of Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">Each provision then provides consequences as to the effect of the certificate when so given.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s137"">However, courts are naturally cautious in construing legislation which has the effect of interfering with what might be regarded as ordinary civil rights of citizens or dealing with other fundamental common law concepts.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">Thus, provisions will be construed so as to preserve those rights unless such interference is shown to be strictly required by clear words or as a matter of necessary implication: Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at p. 252 per Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">18 I am mindful that the context in which the certificate is authorised to be issued in the form it was under the Act occurs in circumstances where, first, a person's civil liberties and other civil rights may be substantially impacted upon and, secondly, those liberties and rights are the subject of the proceedings before the Tribunal.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">19 The question, however, that Parliament has confided to the Attorney-General under each of sections 36, 39A and 39B is the formation of a judgment of a Minister of the Crown that disclosure of particular information would prejudice the security of Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">Necessarily, considerations which are present to the mind of the member of the Executive of the Commonwealth at ministerial level to whom that responsibility is confided are difficult to judge of in a forensic contest, particularly where an issue of public interest immunity or matter of state immunity arises.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">20 The issue to which the Attorney-General's or Minister's attention must be directed is his or her certification that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would prejudice the security of Australia.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s173"">This was a point forcefully made by Hayne JA in the Mobile Oil Australia case where, at p 87, his Honour said: ""Once the documents are inspected by the principals of the trade rival the information which is revealed is known to the trade rival and cannot be forgotten.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s174"">Confidentiality is destroyed once and for all (at least so far as the particular trade rival is concerned).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s175"">To say that the trade rival is bound not to use the documents except for the purposes of the action concerned is, in a case such as this, to impose upon that trade rival an obligation that is impossible of performance by him and impossible of enforcement by the party whose secrets have been revealed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s176"">How is the trade rival to forget what internal rate of return the competitor seeks to achieve on a new investment of the kind in question?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s177"">How is the party whose hurdle rate has been revealed to know whether the rival has used the information in framing a tender?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s178"">Thus, if the trade rival may inspect the documents concerned, the confidentiality of the information in them is at once destroyed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s179"">Is that necessary for the attainment of justice in the particular case?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s180"">""",Sentence
This applies not only to any officers or employees of the respective plaintiffs but also to any solicitor or counsel who may have ongoing responsibilities in advising the plaintiffs or their commercial associates on matters other than the prosecution of the proceedings for which the confidential information in question may have relevance.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s181"">For reasons of this kind in some classes of cases it may sometimes be appropriate to confine disclosure of particular documents to nominated individuals associated with the parties to which disclosure is to be made who have given undertakings to the Court and to the disclosing party, not only restricting the use to which information in the documents may be put, but restricting the future activities of those individuals in representing or advising, or in participating in decision making for, those parties, at least for some specified period of time.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s182"">Such a procedure, however, has its own disadvantages discussed in the cases including the quarantining of the individual to whom the poisoned chalice passes, from providing their services in particular areas and depriving the parties of the benefit of those services, and also creating a situation where agents of a principal are in that capacity put in possession of information, from access to which the principal is excluded.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s183"">'26 In my opinion, the considerations that the submissions made to the Attorney-General reveal about the potential but unsubstantiated risk that Mr Hopper might inadvertently disclose information were not an irrelevant consideration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s184"">The subject matter, scope and purpose of each of sections 36, 39A and 39B indicate that the Minister has an unconfined discretion to have regard to what he, as a high officer of the Executive, considers is in the public interest and may prejudice the security of Australia: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at p. 40 per Mason J; Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 62 ; (1979) 144 CLR 45 at pp.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s185"">49-50.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s186"">27 I am of opinion that one cannot read any of those sections in a way which confines the considerations which the Minister is able to take into account in forming a view as to whether or not a certificate should be issued only to considerations that are able to be substantiated in relation to risk.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s187"">This is particularly so where what is being looked at in the sections is the disclosure of, in effect, information and the ability to safeguard the spread of information which up to the time of the grant of the certificate has been regarded as confidential for, what are not challenged in these proceedings to be, good reasons.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s188"">28 In coming to the conclusion which he did, the Attorney-General was asked to consider whether Mr Hopper should be permitted under section 39A(9)(b) to be present in the Tribunal when evidence was adduced or submissions made which were the subject of the certificate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s189"">The Attorney-General did not give his consent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s190"">Again, it is said that because of his having had regard to the consideration of the potential, but an unintended, risk of Mr Hopper revealing information, the Attorney-General erred in law.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s191"">I do not consider that he did so.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s192"">It was said by counsel for the applicant that the ASIO submission made to the Attorney-General on 21 February 2005 questioned, without a substantive basis, the extent to which, if Mr Hopper were present when the certificated evidence was given or submissions were made, he would be likely to assist the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">The ASIO submission to the Attorney-General relevantly recorded:",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">Mr Hopper would not, however, be able to tell his client anything which would disclose certificated evidence or related submissions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">This prohibition may well mean that Mr Hopper's client will not be able to adduce any responsive evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"29 This passage was criticised on the basis that it, again, raised concerns which were merely speculative.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">I think that in essence the passage may capture, in part, the operation of section 39A(9)(b) and the consequence provided in subsection 39A(10).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">That is to say, if Mr Hopper were present while the confidential material were adduced before the Tribunal, he would not, by force of section 39A(10), be able to reveal any of the material that he so gleaned or learned of to his client.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">Moreover, it would put Mr Hopper into an invidious position at that time for he may then know his client has a perfectly good answer to some of the material, but he would not be free, directly or indirectly, to disclose that answer.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">30 It was then submitted by counsel for the applicant that such a result would inevitably lead in every case to a situation in which consent could never be given.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">I am not sure that that has validity, but it is necessary to consider the facts of the present case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">There may well be cases where, for example, the Attorney-General forms a view as to the prejudice of a particular person having access but where he might form a different view as to the prejudice resulting from another person having access for the purposes of assessing prejudice to security under each of the three sections authorising the issue of certificates.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s203"">31 For these reasons, I am of opinion that the ground that the risk of inadvertent disclosure, albeit unsubstantiated by evidence or tendency evidence on the part of Mr Hopper, was not an irrelevant consideration going to vitiate the issue of the certificates.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s205"">32 Counsel for the applicant faintly put an argument based on Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223, namely that the decision was one which was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at it.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s11"">The fundamental elements of the Medicare Scheme were summarised in the written submissions of the respondent to which the applicant made no objection.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s12"">I gratefully adopt that summary, which (not including footnotes) is as follows:",Sentence
'The Medicare scheme is established under the Health Insurance Act 1973 .</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s13"">The Act was one of the pieces of legislation enacted as a result of the historic joint sitting of the houses of the Federal Parliament in 1974.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s14"">Its long title is 'An Act providing for Payments by way of Medical Benefits and Payments for Hospital Services and for other purposes.</sentence>",Sentence
 Part II of the Act deals with Medicare Benefits.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s16"">Section 10 provides for the payment of benefits for 'medical expenses ... incurred in respect of a professional service' rendered to an eligible person.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s17"">A 'professional service' is, relevantly, a service to which an item in the general medical services table prescribed by the regulations relates, rendered by a medical practitioner, that is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.</sentence>",Sentence
 The provisions of the Act relating to payments by way of medical benefits were enacted pursuant to s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution .</sentence>,Sentence
" Under the Act, Medicare benefits are calculated by reference to the fees ('Schedule fees') for medical services set out in the tables prescribed in the Regulations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s20"">At the relevant time the amount of the benefit for each service was 85% of the Schedule fee.</sentence>",Sentence
" To assist medical practitioners and the public, the tables (including the rules for their interpretation) in the Regulations are published annually by the Department of Health and Ageing in a publication entitled, 'Medicare Benefits Schedule Book', which is provided to all practitioners.</sentence>",Sentence
 Medicare benefits are payable by the Health Insurance Commission ('Commission') on behalf of the Commonwealth to the patient.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s23"">However, a patient may enter into an agreement with the practitioner under which the patient assigns to the practitioner the right to payment of the Medicare benefit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s24"">If such an agreement is entered into, the practitioner must accept the assignment in full payment of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s25"">Assignments provide the means by which the practitioner 'bulk-bills' the Commission in respect of services which attracted Medicare benefits.</sentence>",Sentence
"6 In oral submissions, Mr Robertson SC who appeared for the respondents referred at length to the provision the scheme makes for a patient to assign his or her right to a benefit under the Medicare Scheme to the doctor who provides the medical service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">He stressed that the practitioner's decision to accept an assignment of the benefit is entirely voluntary; there is no compulsion for any doctor to 'bulk-bill'.</sentence>",Sentence
"7 The PSR Scheme was introduced in 1994 and was amended in 1997, 1999 and 2002.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">It is the 1999 version that is relevant to this proceeding; that is the HIA as amended by the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999 (Cth) and the Health Legislation Amendment Act (No 3) 1999 (Cth), (together the Amending Acts) .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">The scheme establishes a process for examining the conduct of a practitioner, in connection with the supply of services which attract a payment under Medicare, in order to determine if the practitioner has engaged in 'inappropriate practice'.</sentence>",Sentence
8 Section 80(1) of the HIA establishes 'inappropriate practice' as the key concept of the PSR.</sentence>,Sentence
'This Part creates a scheme under which a person's conduct can be examined to ascertain whether inappropriate practice (see section 82) is involved.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s33"">It also provides for action that can be taken in response to inappropriate practice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s68"">20 The applicant sought to put certain evidence before the Court including affidavits of Dr Selim and various other extrinsic materials such as explanatory memoranda to relevant legislation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s69"">The respondents did not object to the applicant relying on the extrinsic material although they made the point, correctly in my view, that such material is not evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s70"">They did object to evidence concerning Dr Selim's personal circumstances on the grounds that this evidence is not relevant to the debate as to the constitutional validity of the PSR Scheme.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">They submit that whether Part VAA is valid does not depend on its impact on the applicant as an individual; it cannot be the case that Part VAA is invalid with respect to the applicant and valid for everyone else.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">For this reason the factual propositions relevant to the constitutional challenge must be put at a general and not an individual level.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s73"">It is for this reason, it is submitted, that the leading cases on s 51(xxiiiA) have not had an individual's personal circumstances as their factual base but have proceeded by way of a demurrer to a fully pleaded statement of claim or on a case stated.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s74"">I agree with these submissions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s75"">21 There is no challenge to Dr Selim's standing to bring the present proceeding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s76"">The respondents have accepted that should the applicant be disqualified from participating in the Medicare Scheme, then for the period of the disqualification the applicant's patients would not receive benefits in respect of the applicant's professional services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s77"">The respondents accept that, depending on the length of any disqualification the applicant 'may lose a number of his patients'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s78"">The pervasiveness of the Medicare Scheme and its role in covering an individual's medical expenses or, at least, in subsidising those expenses, is sufficiently well known generally as to allow me to take judicial notice of this and of its impact on medical practitioners who are unable to participate in the scheme; Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149 ; Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 144.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s79"">It is not difficult to conclude that the consequences for a medical practitioner who is excluded from the scheme would be sufficiently serious.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s80"">The disadvantages of operating outside the Medicare Scheme are such as, in my view, to impose practical, if not legal compulsion, to participate in the Scheme.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s81"">22 The written submissions made on behalf of the applicant went into considerable detail about the repercussions for the applicant should he be disqualified from the Medicare Benefits Scheme for up to three years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s82"">These included the virtual devastation of his practice and loss of his livelihood.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s83"">As I have explained above these submissions are not relevant to the issue I have to decide.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s84"">The applicant sought judicial review of the decisions of the Director and the Committee.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s85"">Jacobson J dismissed that application.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s86"">I understand that, pending the outcome of the present constitutional challenge to the legislation, no penalties have been imposed on the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s87"">Whether or not hardship submissions will be relevant to the assessment of any penalty is not for me to say.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">The issue of whether the PSR exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth however, cannot depend on issues of hardship particular to an individual practitioner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s89"">Civil conscription --- the applicant's submissions",Sentence
23 It is not in contention that medical practitioners are not obliged to participate in the Medicare Scheme.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s90"">Nevertheless, the applicant contends that the realities underlying the medical benefits scheme are such that 'realistically, economically and practically' it requires medical practitioners to become approved medical providers in order for them to practise as general practitioners.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s91"">The applicant submits that the HIA requires general practitioners to provide medical services in a manner designated as 'appropriate' but which is 'unstated and undefined'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s92"">According to the applicant, this dictates the 'kinds of and manner in which medical services are actually provided' and attaches significant sanctions to a failure to conform including disqualification from participation in the scheme for up to three years, public reprimand and/or the imposition of substantial repayments of Medicare benefits paid to them or assigned to them by their patients.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s93"">By so doing, the applicant submits, the HIA 'impermissibly' constitutes civil conscription.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s94"">24 Elaborating on this submission the applicant contends that the financial consequences of not participating in the Medicare Scheme create a formidable and real compulsion for general practitioners to do whatever is necessary to enable them to participate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">What is required, it is submitted, goes to the actual medical services to be delivered as well as to the mode or manner of their delivery.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">The applicant submitted:",Sentence
"'The Commonwealth is now therefore present in between , as it were, the general practitioner and his or her patient and the kind of medical service delivered by the practitioner, or whether such service is delivered at all, is untaken by the practitioner having to have strict regard to ... the Commonwealth's requirements.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">The Commonwealth is now empowered to intervene in the actual professional delivery of medical services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">'",Sentence
25 In making these submissions the applicant relies on the decision of the High Court in The General Practitioners Society in Australia v Commonwealth of Australia [1980] HCA 30 ; (1980) 145 CLR 532 ('General Practitioners case').</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">In the alternative the applicant submits that:",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s105"">Background to s 51(xxiiiA)",Sentence
27 Section 51(xxiiiA) was inserted into the Constitution by amendment pursuant to s 128 of the Constitution .</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">The proposed amendment had been approved by the necessary majorities of electors and was assented to on 19 December 1946.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">In explaining the background to this amendment in BMA at 285 , Williams J referred to the different views as to the proper scope of s 81 of the Constitution (Commonwealth power of appropriation) expressed in Attorney-General for Victoria v Commonwealth [1945] HCA 30 ; (1945) 71 CLR 237 (' Pharmaceutical Benefits Case') and to the likelihood, if the point arose for decision, that a majority of the Court would hold that the Commonwealth could only expend its money on those forms of social services expressly authorised by the Constitution , namely invalid and old age pensions authorised by s 51(xxiii).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s108"">The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s 51(xxiiiA) had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription; see also D Mendelson, ""Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee: The History of Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution "" (1999) 23 MULR 308 .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s109"">High Court consideration of s 51(xxiiiA)",Sentence
"28 In the BMA case , the High Court held that the prohibition against civil conscription in s 51(xxiiiA) applied only to medical and dental services and not to the other elements of the section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">At issue was the validity of s 7A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947 (Cth) which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">It was an offence, carrying a penalty of [sterling]50, for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">The majority of the High Court (Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s 51(xxiiiA).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">29 Latham CJ emphasised, at 243, that the power given to the Commonwealth under s 51(xxiiiA) is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services, the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing 'position in the community', that is, a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth, when providing benefits out of public moneys, to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">30 The Chief Justice also said (at 249) that the term 'civil conscription' is wider than 'industrial conscription' and is applicable to ""any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation, perform particular work, or perform work in a particular way.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">"" The Chief Justice emphasised that the words 'any form of' in s 51(xxiiiA) evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be 'completely voluntary'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">Considering s 7A, his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list, the doctor is not given any live option.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting (at 253):",Sentence
" 'There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way, and possibly in the only way, in which he is qualified to earn a living.</sentence>",Sentence
Webb J expressed a similar view at 292-3.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">31 Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion; at 287.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">In his Honour's view, however, the fact that s 7A carried a penalty for non-compliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners, in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary, to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth, the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">Williams J summarised his view at 289:",Sentence
" 'The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment, so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">...</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is super-imposed upon the contract of the parties.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written.</sentence>",Sentence
32 The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at 294:,Sentence
" 'To reiterate: if s 7A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form, which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both, would request a service which only a doctor can render, and which therefore is properly described as a medical service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">But when this service is made compulsory by a fine, or loss of practice to avoid the fine ...then, having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time, it becomes, I think, not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which, if not quite clear, was certainly intended to be comprehensive.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors.</sentence>",Sentence
His Honour's comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">The General Practitioners case",Sentence
33 The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of 'civil conscription' in any detail is the General Practitioners case .</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">Certain provisions of the HIA (ss 16A, 16B and 16C) and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services (other than prescribed pathology services) and also imposed obligations on some, at least, of the persons providing those services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an 'approved pathology practitioner'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">34 The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at 549:",Sentence
"'First, it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">Secondly, it was said, the laws, by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way, compel them to carry on practice in a different way.</sentence>",Sentence

"'The question whether a law imposes civil conscription cannot be answered in the negative simply because the law does not create any legal liability to perform any medical or dental service; the effect of the law in the economic and other circumstances must be considered, and practical compulsion is enough.</sentence>",Sentence
"36 To answer the question it was necessary to examine the provisions of the Act, regulations and undertaking more closely.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">His Honour noted first, at 554, that mere compulsion for a medical practitioner to seek to become an approved pathology practitioner could not in itself 'amount to the imposition of any form of civil conscription'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">Accordingly, his Honour focussed in particular upon those provisions which had the effect of compelling medical practitioners to observe certain positive requirements.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">Those provisions involved the requirement to make (or confirm) requests in writing, to give details of the relevant service in the handwriting of the person making the request and to record other particulars as required by the regulation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">The approved pathology practitioner was also required to retain certain records for 18 months, to ensure that his employees acted in accordance with the legislation and to furnish information as required by the Minister from time to time.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">In relation to these provisions his Honour said, at 559-60:",Sentence
"'The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices, but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out, and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services.</sentence>",Sentence

"37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case (Latham CJ at 249, Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294) to the effect that 'a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">At 557, Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus:",Sentence
"'That expression, ['any form of civil conscription'] used in its natural meaning, and applied, as the context of par.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">(xxiiiA) requires, to medical and dental services, refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">However, in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do, in a particular way, some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service, when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">... it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s159"">...</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s160"">There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression ""any form of civil conscription"" where it appears s 51(xxiiiA) should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s161"">The words ""any form of"" do not, in my opinion, extend the meaning of ""conscription"", and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s162"">Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services, but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA) that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed, and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.</sentence>",Sentence

"38 Gibbs J added that he agreed with the opinion expressed in by Dixon J in the BMA case, that there is a wide distinction between regulating the manner in which an incident of medical practice is carried on (if and when it is done) and the compulsion to serve medically or to render medical services, the latter, but not the former, being within the prohibition.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s166"">39 Despite the disagreement outlined in the passage quoted above, Gibbs J did not regard the BMA case as wrongly decided as it could be supported on narrower grounds.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s167"">His Honour identified the fatal elements in the legislation considered in the BMA case as being:",Sentence
 1. that s 7A required a doctor to write any prescriptions for any medicine included in the prescribed list on the form supplied by the Commonwealth irrespective of whether the medicines were to be obtained free.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s168"">This requirement had no necessary relationship with any pharmaceutical benefit or medical services provided by the Commonwealth; and 2. in the light of its history and context, s 7A could be seen to intend to compel medical practitioners to join the Commonwealth scheme for the provision of free pharmaceutical benefits and to provide 'against their will' a medical service for the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s169"">",Sentence
40 Gibbs J felt that these elements sufficiently distinguished the position under s 7A from that under consideration in the General Practitioners case; see [36] above.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s170"">The only medical service that the provisions in question compelled was, possibly, that required by s 16A(1) of the HIA , namely that a request by medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render an approved pathology service should be made or confirmed in writing.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s171"">Although Gibbs J thought that such a request might be regarded as a medical service he held that the section did not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s172"">Rather it required that the request, if made , be in writing.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s173"">41 Subject to the points made below in [42]-[43], and to some additional observations that are not relevant here, the other members of the High Court agreed with Gibbs J that the provisions under consideration did not impose compulsion amounting to 'civil conscription'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s174"">42 Although it is clear that Gibbs J was of the opinion that practical compulsion, as distinct from legal compulsion, is sufficient to satisfy the concept of 'civil conscription', given the High Court's interpretation of the legislation under consideration in the General Practitioners case it was not necessary to decide this point.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s175"">Indeed, Barwick CJ, Mason J and Wilson J all left this question open.</sentence>",Sentence

 Interpretation of Part VAA,Sentence
"45 I have gone into considerable detail in analysing the General Practitioners case because, in my view, the principles for which it stands apply to the present circumstances and inexorably lead to the conclusion that Part VAA of the HIA does not provide for any form of civil conscription.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s180"">The General Practitioners case clearly shows, however, that careful examination of the specific requirements of challenged legislation is crucial to the determination of whether the constitutional prohibition has been breached.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s181"">46 The salient features of the Medicare Scheme and the PSR Scheme are outlined in [5] --- [13] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s182"">As can be seen, there is no legal compulsion for a medical practitioner to participate in the Medicare Scheme any more than there was for medical practitioners to become approved pathology providers under the legislation considered in the General Practitioners case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s183"">I accept that here, as there in the General Practitioners case, there is a form of compulsion in that it may be severely detrimental, if not fatal, to the viability of a medical practice if the practitioner were excluded from the Medicare Scheme.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s184"">The General Practitioners case clearly establishes, however, that such compulsion is neither a legal nor a practical compulsion to provide a medical service and is not affected by the constitutional prohibition; see [36] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s185"">It is not clear exactly what the High Court meant by 'practical compulsion' but the acceptance ('with equanimity' as Mr Robertson observed) in the General Practitioners case of the fact that a pathologist who did not participate in the statutory scheme under consideration might not have a viable practice shows that such compulsion as is here involved, does not fall within the constitutional prohibition; see the General Practitioners Case at 549-50 per Gibbs J.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s186"">It may be that 'practical compulsion' is a term that follows from an examination of the substance of a statute rather than mere form and is really a conclusion about that which offends the constitutional prohibition.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s187"">In any event I do not need to decide that here.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s188"">47 For the applicant to succeed he would have to show that important aspects of rendering medical services are compulsory under the Medicare Scheme, enforced by the PSR Scheme.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s189"">In making this point Mr Robertson referred to the provision for assignment of benefits under the Medicare Scheme to the medical practitioner who provides the service; see [5]-[6] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s190"">In support of his submission that a medical practitioner was entirely free to accept payment by way of assignment of the benefit he referred to the comments to this effect in Health Insurance Commission v Peverill [1994] HCA 8 ; (1994) 179 CLR 226 at 235 per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s191"">As Mr Robertson explained, a doctor can charge whatever fee he likes for his services; it is only where he voluntarily accepts assignment as full payment that his fee is limited to the amount that the Commonwealth is prepared to pay.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s192"">The fact that the practitioner may be financially advantaged in deciding to accept an assignment does not make the provision compulsory.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">48 As explained at [7] --- [18] above, the PSR Scheme provides for a practitioner's conduct to be examined to determine if he or she has engaged in 'inappropriate practice'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">The consequences attached to a finding of inappropriate practice show that, as the name suggests, the purpose of the provisions is to prevent inappropriate practice rather than to compel the provision of medical services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">Such a simple analysis is, of course, not sufficient to resolve the issues raised by the applicant but it does make clear that the thrust of the provisions is to regulate the conduct of medical practitioners, including the way in which they provide medical services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s196"">49 The applicant accepts that regulating the incidents of medical practice does not offend the constitutional prohibition but contends that the PSR Scheme does more than regulate the incidents of medical practice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">It does not merely regulate the number of services provided or the administrative incidents of medical practice but, it is submitted, the Scheme trespasses into the actual medical services provided not just the manner in which they are provided; it affects the practitioner's clinical decision whether or not to provide a particular service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">This feature alone, the applicant contends, distinguishes the present-day system from that considered by the High Court in the General Practitioners case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">50 In my view this submission does not take sufficient account of Gibbs J's express statement in the General Practitioner's case (see [37] above) that Parliament has the power to make laws as to the manner in which medical services are performed where such laws are 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the Commonwealth's power to provide medical and dental services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">It is incidental to the exercise of the power to provide medical services to be able to make such regulatory laws and to be able to annex conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided, even if this means that medical or dental services have to be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">The making of such laws is not civil conscription provided that 'no compulsion to serve is imposed'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">Therefore the issue here is whether regulation with reference to the criterion of 'inappropriate practice' is 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s203"">51 The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power, whether arising by implication or expressly under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution , it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or, as Rich J said, not to put the cart before the horse; Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533 at 563.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s204"">The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s205"">The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s 81 of the Constitution .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s206"">Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s 81 authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction, the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s207"">His Honour, at 270, put the point thus:",Sentence
 ' [T] he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan; the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money.</sentence>,Sentence
"52 Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, s 51(xxiiiA) has, of course, authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s209"">However, as the General Practitioners case shows, the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s210"">53 The applicant accepts that matters 'merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine' do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealth's administration of its benefits scheme.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s211"">In the applicant's written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s212"">The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealth's provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s213"">54 The applicant is correct that the regulation implicit in the concept of inappropriate practice is capable of going to the heart of medical services rather than merely to ancillary aspects.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s214"">Whether that is different from merely regulating the incidents of medical services I do not need to decide, although I suspect that it is not.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s215"">Ultimately however, I do not accept that a constitutional provision that empowers the Commonwealth to provide medical services, including through the existing network of medical practitioners, at the same time prohibits it from imposing standards on the medical services provided.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s216"">Such standards are integral to the responsible provision of medical services and, as Latham CJ recognised in the BMA case, the Commonwealth's incidental power entitles it to provide for such matters as well as to take the necessary precautions to ensure that public money is properly used; see [29] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s217"">A disciplinary system that is directed to support such precautions (as opposed to a free-standing disciplinary system) would also fall within the incidental power of the Commonwealth even if it could otherwise be viewed as exceeding the power of the Commonwealth because it can be characterised as, for example, a law with respect to the regulation of medical practice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s218"">As the High Court observed in Alexandra Private Geriatric Hospital Proprietary Limitetd v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 6 ; (1987) 162 CLR 271 at 279:",Sentence
 'A single law can possess more than one character and it suffices for constitutional validity if any one or more of those characters fairly falls within a head of Commonwealth legislative power.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s219"">'",Sentence
55 The applicant contends that the concept of inappropriate practice could be anything that a Committee considers it to be; that it could extend to any conduct of the practitioner.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s220"">This submission cannot be sustained.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s221"">Section 80(1) shows that 'inappropriate practice' is a subset of a person's conduct; it refers to examining a person's conduct to ascertain if there has been 'inappropriate practice'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s222"">Inappropriate practice is defined in s 82 (see [8] above).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s223"">The definition restricts the concept to conduct 'in connection with rendering or initiating [medical] services' and provides that it must be such that the Committee could 'reasonably conclude' that the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s224"">The context indicates that the grounds on which the conduct is to be judged must relate to the services that are rendered or initiated.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s225"">Moreover, the Explanatory Memorandum quoted above at [15] indicates that the relevant conduct is conduct in the course of the practice of medicine.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s226"">Were a Committee to attempt to label as 'inappropriate practice' conduct of a medical practitioner that is unrelated to the provision of medical services the appropriate challenge would be, not to the constitutional validity of the PSR, but to the accuracy of the committee's interpretation of the concept.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s227"">56 This point was made in Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453 at 459 where Davies J observed that, notwithstanding the width of the definition of 'inappropriate conduct', it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed:",Sentence
 'The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s228"">Therefore, under Pt VAA, the power to discipline in relation to ""inappropriate practice"" must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s229"">Accordingly, the reference to ""inappropriate practice"" in s 82 refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s230"">The Commonwealth's interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill, that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s233"">However, his Honour's statement that:",Sentence
" 'If the incident of practice which is regulated is not medical or dental, but financial or administrative, it is clearly outside the prohibition',",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s236"">What was crucial for Gibbs J in the General Practitioners case was that no medical service was compelled.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s240"">A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s241"">However, s 16A(1) does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.</sentence>",Sentence

59 I have quoted his Honour's comments at length to make quite clear his Honour's position.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s252"">His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because, put simply, that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself; although it may have been incidental to a medical service; and where a medical service was regulated, as by requiring a request to be made in writing, the medical service itself was not compelled.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s253"">These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s254"">60 In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s255"">For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s256"">The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s257"">The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealth's power under s 51(xxiiiA) to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s258"">In my view a proper application of the term 'inappropriate practice' would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s16"">Subsequently, UB made two unsuccessful attempts to make an agreement directly with its academic and general employees pursuant to s 170LK.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s17"">The first of these proposed s 170LK agreements went to a ballot of staff members between 17 and 21 October 2005.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s73"">13 The applicant contends that the statement which appears in the December 2005 email under Question 1 is false and misleading because the significant differences that do exist make it clear that staff members will in fact lose 'key employment conditions' under the AWA which they would otherwise be entitled to under the EBA.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s81"">The applicant submits that this element of the alleged contraventions will be made out because Mr Walker was directly responsible for the negotiation of the EBA, and also had the conduct of the later unsuccessful attempts to introduce a replacement agreement on behalf of UB.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s82"">As a result, Mr Walker had very detailed knowledge of the terms of the EBA, and the respects in which they differed from the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s83"">In these circumstances, the applicant submits that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Walker knew all of the essential matters which would go to make up the alleged contravention of s 170WG(2), whether or not Mr Walker perceived that the statements in the December 2005 email were false or misleading: see Yorke v Lucas (1985) 159 CLR 661 at 669 per Gibbs CJ; and King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98 at 104-106.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s84"">16 The applicant contends that the December 2005 statements amounted to continuing representations, which may influence staff members who are contemplating the making of an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s85"">Without conceding that there was anything false, misleading or inaccurate about the December 2005 statements, UB disputed the ongoing influence of those statements.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s86"">UB relies upon an affidavit sworn by Mr Walker on 22 February 2006 which points out that a significant amount of additional information has been provided to staff members since 14 December 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s87"">17 On 27 January 2006, UB modified the information on its web page concerning the AWAs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">In particular, the section headed 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' was amended to include, inter alia , the following statements:",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">In contrast, the December 2005 statements were sent by email to all staff members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">19 Mr Walker deposes that information sessions concerning the proposed AWAs were held with academic and general staff in late December 2005 and in January and February 2006.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">At these sessions, Mr Walker says that he explained the workplace disputes clause and the differences between the procedure put in place by the AWA when compared with the EBA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">In addition, Mr Walker deposes that if any staff member was misled by the December 2005 email, then the information sessions conducted by UB and the changes to the 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' web page would have made clear to them that a number of conditions of employment, including those relating to managing under-performance, discipline for misconduct and serious misconduct, redundancy and the resolution of workplace disputes would be altered by the AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">20 UB also relied upon an affidavit by Ms Penelope Faith Irish, a manager employed by UB in the area of accommodation services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">She deposes that she signed an AWA after attending an information session with Mr Walker.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">She refers to differences between the EBA and the AWA in the area of redundancy entitlements, redundancy review processes, dispute resolution processes and the process to manage unsatisfactory performance and allegations of misconduct, but considered those issues to be peripheral and not important to her personally compared with other matters covered by the AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">21 UB also relies upon the fact that since 14 December 2005, the NTEU has provided extensive information to staff members drawing their attention to differences between the proposed AWAs and the EBA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">In his submissions, Dr Jessup QC, senior counsel for UB, recognised that information published by the NTEU may not have the same authority or significance as correcting information that is published by UB.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS",Sentence
22 The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours of the grant of an injunction: see Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396; Australian Coarse Grain Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board of Queensland (1983) 57 ALJR 425; Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55; and Patrick Stevedores Operations (No 2) Proprietary Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 ("" Patrick Stevedores "").</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience: see Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">23 The High Court has recently stressed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 ("" ABC "") that an interlocutory injunction is granted in aid of some legal or equitable right to final relief: see Gleeson CJ at 217 [11]-[12] and 218 [16]; Gaudron J at 232 [60]; and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 240-241 [88]-[91] and 248 [105].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the basic proposition where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought is that it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature (at 241 [91]).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">I leave aside for the moment, as the High Court did, cases where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in some special statutory jurisdiction, and cases where the integrity of the judicial process is protected by forms of relief such as the Mareva order or anti-suit injunctions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">24 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217 [12]).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">25 The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">26 One final and perhaps obvious point that bears repeating is that the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">Ordinarily, the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself as to whether there is a serious question to be tried, or about other matters that may bear on the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED",Sentence
"27 On the material before me, I have concluded that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the December 2005 email contained statements which were knowingly false or misleading, and which were made to staff members of UB with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the significant differences that exist between the EBA and the proposed AWAs, and evidence indicating that Mr Walker has a detailed knowledge of both instruments.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">28 This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, as UB challenges the applicant's legal entitlement to relief on other grounds.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant has not established that the interim relief he seeks is properly connected with any final relief to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">In this context, Dr Jessup relies upon the width of the claims for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">Despite criticism of the terms of relief, the applicant did not seek to narrow the form of the interlocutory injunctions it seeks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">As to the first order, Dr Jessup submitted that s 170WG(2) would not support an interim injunction restraining UB from taking any further step to enter into an AWA with a group member.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">This form of relief, he said, was not directed at restraining the making of, or containing or ameliorating the consequences of, allegedly misleading statements, and would go beyond the relief that could be granted at final trial.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">Dr Jessup criticised the second order on the grounds that it was expressed in broad and sweeping terms, and no Court would issue a restraining order in terms that UB must refrain from making false or misleading statements to group members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">Such an order would do no more than replicate the general terms of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s147"">Dr Jessup criticised the third injunctive order that was sought on the ground that a mandatory order requiring UB to correct the false or misleading statements in the December 2005 email would prejudge the outcome of the case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">In my view, there is some force in these criticisms.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">29 Next, Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant cannot seek an interim order preventing UB from making an AWA with him in circumstances where the applicant asserts that he has not been misled and will not in any event make an AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">In Dr Jessup's submission, the applicant is not seeking an interlocutory remedy for himself, but is trying to do so for other members of the group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">For those members of the group who have already made an AWA, and for those like the applicant who do not intend to make an AWA, it is difficult to say that the interlocutory relief that is being sought is in aid of final relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">The form of relief that is sought is arguably relevant only to those members of the group who have not yet made an AWA, but who may wish to do so.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s153"">30 An applicant in a representative proceeding must himself or herself have standing to sue a particular respondent: see Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 164.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s154"">There is no doubt that the question whether conduct challenged under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was misleading or deceptive can warrant determination on a representative basis, notwithstanding the fact that inducement might be an element of each individuals cause of action: see King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543 at [13] - [14] .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">The applicant submitted that a representative action can be brought seeking final declarations and final injunctions in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">31 In Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 202 ; (2000) 97 FCR 186, the Full Court (comprised of Ryan, Lee and Branson JJ) considered objections to standing in respect of a proceeding that alleged contravention of s 170WG(1) of the WR Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">The proceeding in question was a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">The Full Court rejected an argument that a penalty could not be imposed under s 170VV in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(1) unless the conduct constituting the duress brought about the making of an AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s159"">The Full Court said that such a construction should be rejected because it would allow even the most reprehensible conduct engaged in by a party in relation to a proposed AWA to go unexamined by a Court if no concluded agreement were to come into existence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s160"">On its proper construction the WR Act supported a wider availability of the remedy afforded by s 170VV.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s161"">In addressing this issue, the Full Court also considered whether the trial judge, Moore J, had erred in adding an individual, Mr James Burns, as an additional applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s162"">The alleged error was said to have arisen because Mr Burns had declined the offer of employment and so had never become a party to an AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s163"">The Full Court construed the reference in s 170VV(3) to 'a party to the AWA or ancillary document' so as to include a party to negotiations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s164"">32 It follows therefore that an action for penalties and injunctive relied under ss 170VV and 170VZ can properly be constituted as a representative action: see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 1250 ; (1999) 94 FCR 179.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s165"">I also note that s 33C of the FCA Act provides that a representative proceeding may be commenced whether or not the relief sought is the same for each person represented.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s166"">And I entirely accept the proposition that nothing in s 170VZ excludes this Court's powers under s 23 of the FCA Act to grant an interim or interlocutory injunction in an appropriate case: see Patrick Stevedores at 29 [27] per Brennan CJ; and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 at 103 [96] .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s167"">Nonetheless, it may be a different question whether an applicant can bring an application for interlocutory relief in a representative proceeding, where the applicant has no individual entitlement to that relief, but the relief is sought on the basis that it may be relevant and necessary for other members of the group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s168"">33 Dr Jessup's submissions may also raise issues about the identification of the group members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s169"">In this case, the application alleges that a common issue of law and fact arises, namely whether the December 2005 statements made on behalf of UB were knowingly false or misleading with the intention of persuading the academic and general staff to make the AWA, within the meaning of s 170WG(2) of the WR Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s170"">In respect of these issues, the group may be composed of three different classes of members: first, those like the applicant, who have not signed the AWA and do not intend to do so; second, those who have not signed the AWA and who may wish to do so; and third those who have signed the AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s171"">The affected groups or sub-groups may need to be defined more precisely: ss 33Q and 33ZB of the FCA Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s172"">34 I have not had the benefit of full argument on any of the issues raised by these submissions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s173"">I do not propose to express from views about the submissions discussed in [28] to [29] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s174"">In all the circumstances, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to relief at trial.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s175"">In view of the matters relied upon by Dr Jessup, however, I consider that the case that has been demonstrated by the applicant at this stage is towards the weaker end of the spectrum.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s176"">As will appear it is unnecessary for me to be more definitive, as I have reached the conclusion that the application for interim relief should be refused on other grounds.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s177"">BREACH OF AN IMPLIED TERM OF TRUST AND CONVENIENCE",Sentence
35 The applicant's outline of written submissions contains an allegation that an implied term of trust and confidence should be implied into each group member's contract of employment with UB: see generally Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; and Heptonstall v Gaskin (No 2) (2005) 138 IR 103.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s178"">The outline further alleges that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached this implied term by recklessly or knowingly making false or misleading statements to its staff members concerning the terms and conditions of employment which would apply to them if they entered into the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s179"">36 The application by which these proceedings was instituted does not contain any reference to these allegations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s180"">Nor is it mentioned in any of the affidavits that were filed by the applicant in support of its application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s181"">The first notice that UB had of these allegations came when the applicant's counsel handed up the outline of written submissions at the commencement of the interlocutory hearing.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s182"">In these circumstances, Dr Jessup said that he did not intend to address any submissions to these allegations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s183"">37 I am not satisfied at this stage that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached any such implied contractual term.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s184"">The basic case that has been put is simply that Mr Walker made statements that were false and misleading in circumstances which gave rise to a contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s185"">38 In view of the lack of notice of these allegations to the respondent, and the lack of evidence directed to the breach of the alleged implied term, I do not propose to discuss these allegations any further.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s186"">I note as well that the applicant hardly addressed any submissions to the alleged breach of implied term.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s187"">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE",Sentence
39 The grant of an interlocutory injunction is discretionary.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s188"">In exercising that discretion, the Court will closely examine the balance of convenience.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s189"">This involves weighing up the extent of any impending prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant if injunctive relief is not granted pending trial, and weighing that against the extent of any hardship that the grant of the injunction may cause the respondent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s190"">It also needs to be borne in mind that the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo, and that the interlocutory injunction is granted so as to preserve or protect the legal or equitable rights that are sought to be vindicated in the proceedings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s191"">One relevant inquiry for the Court will be whether irreparable injury which is not compensable in damages will result if relief is not granted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s192"">40 The applicant submits that irreparable harm will occur if injunctive relief is not granted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">He submits that the Court is not empowered to revoke an AWA even if it is made in reliance on false or misleading statements made in contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">This is said to follow from the fact that an AWA, once filed, takes on a statutory character.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">Section 170VM sets out the circumstances when an AWA may be terminated, and the applicant points out that none of them apply to the present circumstances.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s196"">Further, the applicant submits that the Court is not empowered to make an order for damages in respect of any loss suffered in consequence of a breach of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">UB also submitted that the Court is not empowered to set aside an AWA after it has been filed, and takes on a statutory character.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">41 The applicant's case for interlocutory relief was based on the premise that the December 2005 statements were continuing to operate, and might mislead staff members into making an AWA between the time of the hearing and the determination of the proceeding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">The interim relief is not relevant to those members of the group who have already made AWAs, or those members of the group who, like the applicant, possess full information and do not intend to make an AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">42 In my opinion, the legitimate purpose of an interlocutory injunction at this point, pending trial, is to eliminate or mitigate the risk that staff members of UB might be misled by the December 2005 statements into making an AWA if no relief is granted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">43 The starting point, therefore, is to consider what relief, if any, is just, convenient or necessary at this point to address the risk that the December 2005 statements are continuing to operate and may influence staff members to enter into an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">44 UB has submitted that the continuing influence of the December 2005 statements is likely to be minor, if they have any continuing effect at all.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s203"">UB submits that the academic community at UB is generally well informed about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s204"">Moreover, UB submits that the December 2005 statements have been overtaken by a substantial amount of subsequent information.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s205"">While there is some force in these submissions, there must remain a risk that the December 2005 statements may have some ongoing influence on some staff members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s206"">45 UB has submitted that any case which might otherwise have existed for the grant of interim relief is met by UB's preparedness to offer an undertaking to the Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s207"">A form of undertaking was provided to me during the course of the hearing.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s208"">In essence, the undertaking is to the effect that UB will make a further extensive clarification statement to all staff members identifying the differences between the proposed AWA and the EBA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s209"">Further, UB said that it would undertake to refrain from entering into AWAs with its staff members until the expiry of a period of seven days after the publication of the new information to its staff members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s210"">By this means, UB submitted that any risk that staff members might enter into an AWA on the basis of misleading or false statements would be removed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s211"">46 At the time of the hearing of the interlocutory application, the applicant and his counsel had not had a full opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s212"">I directed that the parties consult with each other about the terms of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s213"">I further directed that UB submit a final form of the proposed undertakings after a process of consultation had taken place.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s214"">UB has now submitted a final form of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s215"">I have been informed that the parties have agreed upon the terms of the clarification statement, but no agreement was reached about other aspects of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s216"">I shall not set the proposed undertakings in these reasons, as they are recorded in the orders which I propose to make.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s217"">47 In my opinion, the undertakings proposed by UB are a complete answer to the application for interim relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s218"">The proposed undertakings remove any real risk that staff members will be induced to enter into AWAs between the date of my order and the date of trial as a result of the allegedly misleading statements that were made in December 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s219"">48 In the light of the undertakings proffered by UB, I consider that the hardship that would be occasioned by the grant of wide interlocutory injunctions of the kind sought by the applicant outweighs any prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant and other group members that would be occasioned by withholding relief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s220"">The undertakings afford the best means of preserving the status quo pending trial, and address the risk that the December 2005 statements may have a continuing influence on staff members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s221"">In short, the undertakings produce an outcome that is both just and convenient.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s222"">49 A number of other factors support the conclusion that it is neither just nor convenient to grant the interlocutory relief sought by the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s223"">Some of them are discretionary factors.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s224"">50 First, the relief sought by the applicant is cast in extremely wide terms and arguably goes beyond relief that could be legitimately sought in this proceeding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s225"">51 Secondly, the relief sought by the applicant would seriously impinge upon the rights of third parties.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s226"">An injunction restraining UB from entering into an AWA with its staff members pending the trial of this action would seriously affect the rights of those staff members, including their entitlement to back-pay.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s227"">The applicant submits that the risk that such employees would lose their entitlement to back-pay if AWAs cannot be concluded by 31 March 2006 is an arbitrary limitation that was imposed by UB, and it can be varied at UB's discretion.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s228"">I will assume that this is so.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s229"">Nonetheless, it is relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the form of relief that has been sought will significantly affect the rights of other staff members.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s230"">Their rights will be affected if the injunction were to go, whether or not the employees have fully informed themselves about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s231"">Employees may be so affected even if they opt out of the represented group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s232"">If there is another alternative that protects staff members from the risk that they will be misled by the December 2005 statements, such as that offered by the undertakings, it is a relevant consideration that the more drastic alternative proposed by the applicant will affect the rights of third parties.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s233"">52 The applicant submits that the position of third parties will be protected by its undertaking as to damages.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s234"">The usual form of undertaking in this Court extends beyond the damages which may be suffered by the respondent consequent upon the interlocutory order, and includes damages that may be suffered by other persons.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s235"">In this case, the applicant has proffered his own undertaking jointly with an undertaking by the NTEU.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s236"">I accept that a joint undertaking as to damages by the applicant and the NTEU is one of substance.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s237"">However, I do not consider that the availability of the undertaking can justify the making of an interim order that will seriously affect third party rights, in circumstances where there is another alternative that is both just and convenient and which will not adversely affect third party rights.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s238"">53 In this case, I would not discount the significance of the impact on third party rights in the way that Finkelstein J did in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2000) 106 IR 139 at [57].</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s27"">6 In 1988 Mr Williams began working with others on the development of a three peaked mountain logo for use in conjunction with the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">The logo took its final form by 1991.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">Thereafter the mountain logo was displayed on ""Colorado"" shoes on the inner sole, the bottom of the sole and on the outside of the upper of the shoes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">7 Although new to Australia in 1982, the Colorado mark was not a new mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s31"">Mr Williams described it as a ""generic name"" used by the parent company (Woolworths Corporation) on goods marketed in the United States.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s32"">In describing the mark as a ""generic name"" Mr Williams meant that it was an ""in-house"" brand name used by Woolworths as a trade mark for its own products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s33"">Footlocker and Lynx are examples of other ""generic names"" used by Woolworths Corporation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s34"">Goods bearing the Colorado mark (backpacks and shoes) were acquired for sale through the agency of Woolworths Overseas Corporation, which, I assume, was another Woolworths subsidiary.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s35"">That company arranged for the manufacture of merchandise bearing ""generic names"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s36"">Representatives of the Australian subsidiary, and presumably also of subsidiaries in other countries, visited WOC's offices where sample goods were available for inspection.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s37"">If a subsidiary wished to purchase any of those goods the order for their manufacture would be placed by WOC, which was also responsible for quality control and ensuring that the goods met the local company's specifications.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s39"">8 The volume of Colorado backpacks sold through Williams the Shoemen stores was relatively modest.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s40"">On the other hand, some considerable success was being achieved with the sale of Colorado shoes through both Williams the Shoemen and Mathers stores, especially as the range available increased and the quality improved.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s41"">While detailed accounting records are no longer available it is estimated that in 1990 around $8 million worth of Colorado branded products was sold by the two stores.</sentence>",Sentence

"The proposal suggested that the brand's ""new image"" be built around the Colorado mountain logo.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s58"">It noted: ""Under Australian trademark law, registration of geographical names are [sic] difficult.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s61"">""",Sentence
11 In July 1992 the Woolworths Corporation resolved to go ahead with the proposal.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s62"">During the next 12 months Mr Beagley and others within the Colorado Group developed a range of products that were to be sold through the Colorado stores.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s63"">The products were clothing, footwear, accessories (including backpacks, socks, hats, underwear and shoe care items), leather and non-leather belts, bags and wallets.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s64"">12 Three Colorado stores were opened in July 1993.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s65"">One was located in Doncaster, Victoria, another in Parramatta, New South Wales and the third in Penrith, New South Wales.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s66"">A fourth store was opened in September 1993, in Darling Harbour, Sydney, New South Wales.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s67"">Each store was stocked with a full range of Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s68"">Some, such as bags, were marked with the Colorado mark alone while others were marked with both the Colorado mark and the mountain logo.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s69"">Although the word Colorado was sometimes used in isolation, the predominant use of the word was in association with the mountain logo, particularly in relation to footwear, bags, handbags and other accessories.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s70"">During the next three years (1993 to 1996) six more Colorado stores were opened, three in New South Wales, two in Queensland and one in Victoria.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s71"">13 Initially the new venture was not profitable but this was not unexpected.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s72"">In 1997 or 1998 it was decided to change the ""image"" of the Colorado brand and expand the number of Colorado outlets.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s73"">Ms Hudson, at the time the general merchandise manager, was behind the move.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s74"">Her idea was to redefine the Colorado image to an ""Australian lifestyle"" brand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s75"">Ms Hudson described this style as ""a lot cleaner and smarter"" than the previous ""outdoor"" image.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s76"">Under Ms Hudson's watch the number of Colorado stores expanded significantly and the range of Colorado branded products grew to encompass items such as watches and eyewear.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s77"">By this time the mark ""Colorado"" was used principally alone.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s78"">The result of the changes in style as well as a significant increase in advertising was that turnover improved dramatically.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s79"">14 It is now time to say something about the respondent, Strandbags Group Pty Limited.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s80"">The company was incorporated in New South Wales in 1983 and currently operates (in some cases through franchisees) a chain of 186 stores around Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s81"">It is a speciality retailer of bags, travel goods, backpacks, wallets and other small leather goods and accessories.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s82"">It has an extensive portfolio of registered trade marks, including a mark that incorporates the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s83"">Goods branded with the Colorado mark were originally put onto the market by Edgarlodge Pty Ltd, a company owned and controlled by Lee Evans and his wife.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s84"">Edgarlodge's business was established in the 1980s.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s85"">It sold bags, luggage, briefcases and accessories, initially under the business names ""The Travel Bug"" and ""Bagstop"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s86"">15 In the early years Edgarlodge obtained its stock from Australian importers and local manufacturers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s87"">In the latter part of the 1980s Mr Evans began to investigate the possibility of importing his own products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">He also considered what brand name he should use for the imported goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s89"">He chose the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s90"">He says this was because he had been looking for something with an American influence and being a John Denver fan was fond of ""Colorado Rocky Mountain High"" describing it as ""one of [my] favourite songs"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s91"">""Colorado Rocky Mountain High"" is not the title of a Denver song, but is a recurring line in a song entitled ""Rocky Mountain High"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s92"">At all events, Mr Evans said that he decided to use the word ""Colorado"" in early 1990.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s93"">He also said that he was not aware of anyone else in Australia using that name.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s94"">Mr Evans conducted a search at the Trade Marks Office and the Australian Securities Commission to see if anyone had registered a mark or business name using the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">The searches disclosed that ""Colorado"" was neither a registered business name nor a registered trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">When it was discovered that the word was apparently available for use, Edgarlodge applied for and obtained registration of the business name ""Colorado Leathergoods"" on 30 May 1990.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">16 I am very dubious about Mr Evans' evidence concerning his choice of the mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">That he was a John Denver fan may be accepted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">But I do not believe the rest of his story.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s100"">I suspect that Mr Evans had come across the name on goods (probably goods sold by one of the applicants) and wanted to use it but needed to check if anyone (perhaps one of the applicants) had rights in respect of it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s101"">17 Moving on, in early 1991 Mr Evans' secretary, Ms Priest, prepared a design for a logo to be used in conjunction with the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s102"">The logo was the head of an American Indian.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">In due course the word and logo mark was registered as a combination mark in respect of handbags, travelgoods and belts in class 18.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">The products initially manufactured bearing the new mark (the word ""Colorado"" with the Indian head logo) were a range of handbags.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">The mark was embossed on the front of each handbag.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">Sales of the new line began in 1991 at Edgarlodge's then eleven Queensland stores.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">In 1992 changes were effected to the style of the mark ""Colorado"" and to the Indian head and applied to the then existing range of over twenty-four styles of handbag.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s108"">The handbags proved to be popular so new products were added to the range, such as suitcases, wallets, key cases and coin purses.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s109"">As the range expanded to include other products, the combination mark was applied to them as well.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">Between 1995 and 1998 the combination mark was applied to goods such as backpacks, briefcases and associated products as well as handbags.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">Depending on the size of the product, the word and logo were either stamped on a leather patch and sewn onto the product or stamped directly onto the product.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">As the range of goods continued to expand this practice varied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">For example, the word ""Colorado"" was stamped onto a gold metal tag and affixed to handbags, business bags and luggage.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">The word ""Colorado"" was also printed on business card inserts that were placed inside wallets.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">18 In August 1992 Edgarlodge opened a retail store in Liverpool, New South Wales.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">The store was designed as a ""Colorado theme store"" with the word ""Colorado"" in the shopfront design and on many Colorado products that were sold alongside other products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">The Liverpool store closed in April 1994.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">Mr Evans said that this was due to its poor location.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">At the same time there was a substantial increase in the volume and range of Colorado branded products sold by Edgarlodge at its other stores.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">These were products on which the combination mark or the Colorado mark alone was affixed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">From 1995 to 1997 Edgarlodge opened fourteen stores that traded under the name ""The Colorado Bag Co"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">By this time, the Colorado side of Edgarlodge's business had become a sizable operation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">In the years 1997 and 1998 sales of Colorado branded products totalled $1.27 million and $2.08 million respectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">19 Strandbags Group came into the picture in September 1998 when it purchased from Edgarlodge the businesses conducted under the names ""The Travel Bug"", ""The Colorado Bag Co"" and ""Bagstop"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">Included among the assets purchased was the goodwill relating to the business carried on by Edgarlodge at its ""The Travel Bug"", ""The Colorado Bag Co"" and ""Bagstop"" outlets.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">In addition Strandbags Group also purchased from Edgarlodge several business names, including those just mentioned, together with a number of registered trade marks, including the Colorado with Indian head mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">20 Following the acquisition Strandbags Group decided to ""liquidate"" the stock it had just purchased, as well as stock that was currently on order by Edgarlodge and for which Strandbags Group had assumed responsibility.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">Included among the stock to be ""liquidated"" was all Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">The intention was to replace this stock with stock manufactured by Strandbags Group's own suppliers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">There were two reasons.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">First, Edgarlodge's computerised inventory system was not compatible with that of Strandbags Group and, second, it wished to produce a better quality product.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">It regarded itself as catering to ""the professional woman seeking a stylish, leather, functional [product]"" and who was shopping for the ""Australian casual"" look.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">21 The liquidation of the Colorado stock was completed by about March 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">Thereafter, apart from handbags, the stock was replaced by Strandbags Group's own lines of footwear, leathergoods (wallets and the like), backpacks, travel goods and business goods (mainly satchels) all marked ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">A range of Colorado branded handbags was designed and introduced in 2002.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">The range is now very extensive.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">Indeed, overall the categories of Colorado products sold by Strandbags Group are substantially larger than those that were supplied by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">22 Having provided a sketch of some of the more important facts, I can now deal with the claims.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">As I have said, Colorado Group's principal claim is for trade mark infringement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">By way of answer there is a substantial attack against the validity of the registration of the mark and a cancellation order is sought.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">It is, I think, convenient to deal with this aspect first.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">The application for cancellation is made under s 88.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">Two grounds are relied upon.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">One relies on grounds upon which the registration of the mark could have been opposed (s 88(2)(a)).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">Here it is said that Colorado Group was not the proprietor of the mark or, if it was the proprietor, the mark was not distinctive of its goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">The other ground is that registration was obtained by false suggestion or misrepresentation (s 88(2)(e)).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s147"">23 I will look at proprietorship first.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">In In re Hicks's Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636, Holroyd J said (at 639): ""A person cannot be properly registered [under the Trades Marks Act] unless he is the proprietor.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">Proprietor is the person who at the moment he makes application to be registered is entitled to the exclusive use of the name, whether he then or before publicly adopted it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">"" Broadly speaking, a person may be the proprietor of a mark in one of two ways.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">First, in respect of a mark which has never been used the proprietor is the person who is (or claims through) the author of the mark (which could include the copyist of a foreign mark) and intends to use it: In re Hudson's Trade-Marks (1886) 32 Ch D 311, 319-320; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601, 627-628.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">Second, a person may be the proprietor of a mark if he has used it, provided no-one else has used the mark before him.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s153"">This last proposition requires some elaboration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s154"">In the case of an inherently distinctive mark nothing more than first use is necessary to establish proprietorship.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">The applicant need not show that the mark has gained public recognition.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">Any general use of the mark as a trade mark will be enough, although in a rare case the use may be so inconsequential that it should be ignored as de minimus.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">Perhaps care should also be taken when there has been only a slight use of the mark followed by a long period of non-use, where something akin to the doctrine of abandonment might apply.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">If a mark is not inherently distinctive but indicates that an article emanates from some (usually anonymous) source because, or partly because, the mark has acquired a secondary meaning, strictly speaking first use is not sufficient to establish proprietorship.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s159"">To make out proprietorship it is also necessary to show that the mark does in fact distinguish the applicant's goods from the goods of others.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s160"">Even if this is not an aspect of proprietorship (as I think it is), unless a secondary meaning is established s 41 would bar registration of the mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s161"">24 When considering proprietorship it is important to remember that there is no proprietorship in a mark per se.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s162"">Under the common law ""property in a trade-mark is ... the right to the exclusive use of some mark, name or symbol in connection with a particular manufacture or vendible commodity"": Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Couch Co Ltd (1863) 4 De G J &amp; S 137, 144.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s163"">See also Ainsworth v Walmsley (1866) 1 Eq 518, 524 (""This Court has taken upon itself to protect a man in the use of a certain trade-mark as applied to a particular description of article"").</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s164"">The position is no different under the Trade Marks Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s165"">The effect of the current statute, which is substantially similar to earlier legislation, is that a trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or services specified in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 (Cth): Trade Marks Act , ss 19 , 27 in combination with Trade Mark Regulations, reg 3.1, 4.4, Sch 1.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s166"">25 It follows that proprietorship by first use is proprietorship in relation to the goods or classes of goods on which the mark has been used.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s167"">The proprietor is entitled to have his mark registered in respect of those goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s168"">This entitlement is not confined to identical goods or classes of goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s169"">Registration may also be obtained for goods or classes of goods which is or are ""a thing [or things] of the same kind"" ( Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 160, 178) or ""like articles of production"" ( Columbia Mill Company v Alcorn , 150 US 460, 464 (1893)) or ""articles of merchandise of the same kind"" ( Colman v Crump , 70 NY 573, 578 (1877)) or ""kindred articles"" ( The Collins Co v Oliver Ames &amp; Sons Corporation , 18 F 561, 570 (1882)), if there be any difference between these expressions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s170"">See also Edwards v Dennis (1885) 30 Ch D 454.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s171"">26 With this background in mind the first question to be resolved on proprietorship is whether as at 16 February 2001, Colorado Group was the proprietor of the mark ""Colorado"" in respect of backpacks, bags, wallets, purses and belts and for services in respect of those articles.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s172"">In looking at this question I will assume for the time being, though it is a matter in dispute, that the mark was capable of being distinctive of Colorado Group's goods and services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s173"">The answer to the first question requires consideration of three issues, viz (1) Was Colorado Group or its predecessor the first user of the Colorado mark on a backpack, being the article in respect of which first use is claimed?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s174"">(For this purpose it is conceded that Williams the Shoemen was the predecessor of Colorado Group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s175"">It is also conceded that Williams the Shoemen was the first user of the word ""Colorado"" in combination with the ""simple mountain motif""); (2) If the word was applied to backpacks not alone but in combination with the ""simple mountain motif"" can Colorado Group (or its predecessor) nevertheless claim to be the first user of the Colorado mark?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s176"">; (3) If Colorado Group (or its predecessor) was the first user of the Colorado mark on backpacks, is a bag, wallet, purse or belt the same kind of article?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s177"">Unless each pair of questions (1) and (3), or (2) and (3), are answered affirmatively, the registration has gone too far and either Colorado Group is not the proprietor of the Colorado mark or is not the proprietor in respect of bags, wallets, purses and belts.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s178"">It may be that Edgarlodge first used the word ""Colorado"" on those goods, albeit in combination with the Indian head logo.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s179"">27 Before I answer the question -- Is Colorado Group or its predecessor the proprietor of the Colorado mark by first use?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s180"">-- it is necessary to get out of the way two preliminary points.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s181"">The first is this.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s182"">It was suggested (perhaps only faintly) that when Williams the Shoemen and Colorado Group used the word ""Colorado"" on shoes and backpacks it was not use as a trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s183"">To determine whether this submission is correct I will proceed on the basis that if the word was used in a manner that would be understood by the public to indicate that the goods came from a definite or particular source, or that they emanated from the same, albeit anonymous, source as certain other goods, that is use as a trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s184"">It is quite clear that the word ""Colorado"" appearing on backpacks with or without the ""simple mountain motif"" was used to distinguish those goods as having a particular origin: that is, it was used as a trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s185"">It served no other function on the backpacks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s186"">The use of the mark on shoes presents some difficulty.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s187"">One can readily imagine a designation, especially a word, applied to an article that comes in several styles, being used to distinguish the style and no more.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s188"">Here, the photographs depicting the boxes in which the shoes were packed shows quite clearly a trade mark use.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s189"">In any event I think this conclusion is inevitable in the case of the combination mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s190"">28 The second preliminary point is whether the mark ""Colorado"" was used as a trade mark by Colorado Group or by Woolworths Corporation, the United States parent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s191"">In support of a submission that the use was by Woolworths Corporation alone, Strandbags Group relies on a passage from Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd [1966] HCA 81 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254, 271:",Sentence
" ""[W]e have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country, by means of sales to Australian retail houses, goods bearing his mark and the goods, bearing his mark, are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country, the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s192"">Indeed, in this case, the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re-sale does not, in any relevant sense, use it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">""",Sentence
29 In my opinion that case does not support the argument.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">In the first place Estex established only that when a foreign owner of an Australian trade mark sells imported goods bearing the mark and the goods are then sold in Australia the foreign owner uses the mark in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">The case did not consider whether the local retailer also used the mark: Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670, 688.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s196"">In the second place there is little similarity between the facts of this case and those in Estex .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">Woolworths Corporation was not a foreign manufacturer of goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">It was not the owner of an Australian trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">It did not sell goods bearing the Colorado mark for delivery in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">What we have here is a local retailer which, through the agency of a related company, arranged for goods to be manufactured overseas bearing a mark nominated by the local retailer and then imported the goods for retail sale.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">The only involvement of Woolworths Corporation is that it authorised its local subsidiary to use one of its in-house marks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">It no doubt permitted other subsidiaries to use those marks in other jurisdictions.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s203"">However that may be, merely authorising a person to use a mark in Australia is not use in Australia by the person giving the authority.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s204"">It is clear in my view that only Colorado Group used the mark in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s205"">30 Having got these preliminary points out of the way, I can now return to the first question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s206"">As I have said, it is not in dispute that Colorado Group used the word ""Colorado"" in combination with the ""simple mountain motif"" on backpacks and shoes before the word ""Colorado"" was used by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s207"">Speaking generally, however, a person who is the proprietor of a combination mark is not the proprietor for trade mark purposes of the marks comprising each separate component: In re J B Palmer's Trade-Mark (1883) 24 Ch D 504; In re Royal Baking Powder Co [1880] WN 49; Richards v Butcher [1891] 2 Ch 522.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s208"">But there may be exceptions to the general rule.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s209"">In BP plc v Woolworths Ltd (2004) 62 IPR 545 I was required to consider whether it was possible to dissect a mark that was made up of several components and obtain trade mark registration of only one component.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s210"">I said (at 567-568) that it could be done, provided the component for which registration is sought ""creates an impression which is totally separate from the other[s] and is distinctive, that is it performs the trade mark function of identifying the source of the goods and services to customers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s211"">"" While I have heard no evidence on the point, my impression here is that each component (or at least the word) serves that function.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s212"">On this basis, then, Colorado Group could be regarded as the first user of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s213"">31 There is another basis for this conclusion.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s214"">As regards backpacks (being the only article in respect of which there is a possibility of establishing first use of the word mark) I agree with Mr Ryan that it is unclear whether the word ""Colorado"" was accompanied by the logo, at least in the early years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s215"">There were only two witnesses called who were with Williams the Shoemen in 1982 and onwards, Mr Williams and Mr Ainsworth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s216"">In his affidavit Mr Williams said that the backpacks were packaged in a cellophane bag which bore the printed word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s217"">He also said the word ""Colorado"" was embroidered on the front of the backpack without the ""simple mountain motif"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s218"">In oral evidence he said he was ""sure that there was [the mark] across the top flap of the backpack.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s219"">A recollection of the logo I cannot recollect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s220"">"" When pressed he said: ""[I] couldn't rule it [the mountain logo] out.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s221"">"" Mr Ainsworth's recollection went back only to the mid-1980s.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s222"">He said that at that time the mark on the backpacks comprised the word ""Colorado"" and the mountain logo.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s223"">Given this state of the evidence it is not possible to reach any conclusion about the nature of the mark on backpacks between 1982 and, say, 1985.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s224"">In particular, one cannot say with any confidence that the mark comprised both the word and logo.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s225"">This conclusion is necessarily adverse to Strandbags Group which carries the onus on the cross-claim.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s226"">32 On the last of the three questions -- Are bags, wallets, purses and belts the ""same kind"" of goods as a backpack?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s227"">-- the answer in my view is in the negative.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s228"">First it must be recalled that the style of backpack in respect of which the mark was used (and in respect of which it could be registered) was designed and promoted principally for use by schoolchildren for carrying stationery, books and other school items.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s229"">There are other styles of backpack, for example fashion backpacks or those used for mountain-climbing and hiking, but they are not the type with which the comparison must be made.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s230"">Broadly speaking, a ""bag"" is a receptacle made of some flexible material closed in on all sides except at the top: see Oxford English Dictionary vol 1 (2 nd ed, 1989) 880.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s231"">There are, however, many different types of bags.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s232"">They are as varied as plastic bags, bodybags, laundry bags etc.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s233"">Thus, not every bag can be the ""same kind of thing"" as a schoolboy's backpack.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s234"">In particular, a schoolboy's backpack is not akin to a ladies handbag.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s235"">Those are usually intended as a fashion item for the female consumer (albeit for an everyday use).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s236"">Articles such as wallets, purses and belts are even more dissimilar to the schoolboy's backpack given their respective, and different, uses.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s237"">This is not a case where the proprietor of a mark which has been applied to different kinds of articles that fall within a class or category of goods seeks to register that mark in respect of other articles within the class or category.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s238"">Such a proprietor would be entitled to register his mark not only for each article in the class to which the mark has been applied but also for such other articles in the class which a consumer would reasonably believe are likely to originate from the same source.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s239"">33 The next ground of attack against the registration of the trade mark is that it was not distinctive of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s240"">The point arises in the following way.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s241"">Generally, a word, name or device (or any other designation that may be a ""sign"" for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act ) can only be distinctive of a person's goods or services if it is ""inherently adapted to distinguish"" those goods or services or, if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has become distinctive by use, that is if it has acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s242"">A designation that is merely descriptive of the character of the goods or of their geographic origin or location cannot be inherently distinctive.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s243"">At least in the case of a geographic description ""there is necessarily great difficulty in proving that by reason of use or other circumstances [the designation] does in fact distinguish his goods"": Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks [1964] HCA 55 ; (1964) 111 CLR 511, 515 per Kitto J in an oft quoted passage.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s244"">34 As a matter of principle, the ""great difficulty"" that confronts an applicant who seeks to register a descriptive mark, especially a mark that describes the location or origin of goods, should be found to exist only in the case of a term that has that effect in relation to the specific goods for which registration is sought.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s245"">As regards a geographic term, in my opinion the comment on Subdivision (a) of SS720 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts, vol III (1938) correctly states the position.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s246"">The comment reads:",Sentence
" ""The reasons for the rule that geographical names cannot be trademarks do not weigh heavily when the geographical name has obviously only an arbitrary or fanciful significance in connection with the goods upon which it is used.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s247"">Thus Gibraltar may be a trade-mark for automobiles since there is no likelihood that such use of the name would lead purchasers to suppose that there is any particular relation between the automobiles and the geographical locations known by that name, or any likelihood that it would seriously interfere with the freedom of merchants at Gibraltar to use that name.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s248"">Again, Ethiopian may be a proper trade-mark for ladies' stockings; for, while suggestive of a certain color and sheen, it is only fancifully so and there is no likelihood that other merchants may have occasion properly to use the name Ethiopia on stockings since there is no factor of importance associating stockings with Ethiopia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s249"">Such is also the case of Pacific for bread or Arctic for refrigerators.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s250"">""",Sentence
"Reference should also be made to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co v Wolf Brothers &amp; Co , 240 US 251 (1916).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s251"">The case concerned a trade mark consisting of the words ""The American Girl"" as applied to women's shoes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s252"">The Supreme Court said of this mark (at 256-257): ""We do not regard the words 'The American Girl,' adopted and employed by complainant in connection with shoes of its manufacture, as being a geographical or descriptive term.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s253"">It does not signify that the shoes are manufactured in America, or intended to be sold or used in America, nor does it indicate the quality of characteristics of the shoes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s254"">Indeed, it does not, in its primary signification, indicate shoes at all.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s255"">It is a fanciful designation, arbitrarily selected by complainant's predecessors to designate shoes of their manufacture.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s256"">We are convinced that it was subject to appropriation for that purpose, and it abundantly appears to have been appropriated and used by complainant and those under whom it claims.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s257"">""",Sentence
35 In order to decide whether a geographic term is used descriptively one would ordinarily make the following kinds of inquiries: (1) Is the mark the name of the place from which the goods come?</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s258"">; (2) Is the geographic term likely to denote to a reasonable purchaser that the goods come from the place or region named?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s259"">; (3) Is the place or region noted for the particular goods in question?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s260"">See generally McCarthy on Trade Marks and Unfair Competition , vol 2 SS14.7.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s261"">The result of such inquiries would likely show, for instance, that consumers would perceive as designating geographic origin the word ""Swiss"" when applied to watches, the word ""Japan"" when applied to motor vehicles, the word ""Brazil"" when applied to coffee beans and, for those with a local interest, the words ""Bank of Melbourne"" in relation to banking services.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s262"">On the other hand, I am certain in my own mind that the word ""Colorado"" when applied to backpacks or other articles, such as shoes, is not used in a geographical sense.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s263"">The use of the word ""Colorado"" in connection with the kinds of goods with which we are concerned is an arbitrary use making it inherently distinctive and thus requiring no proof of secondary meaning.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s264"">36 In reaching this conclusion, I have rejected the possibility, with one slight exception, that the word ""Colorado"" can be descriptive of backpacks or shoes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s265"">I have referred to the evidence which is to the effect that the word ""Colorado"" conjures up notions of trekking, ruggedness, fashion, Rocky Mountains and so on.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s266"">For the most part those ideas are concerned with the image of the brand and are not descriptive of the goods themselves.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s267"">The slight exception is that the word may incidentally say something about quality (for example that the goods are ""rugged"" or durable) but because the word is only indirectly informative it is not likely to be perceived by many in a descriptive sense.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s268"">Thus the attack based on lack of distinctiveness is not made out.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s269"">37 To deal with the allegation that the trade mark registration was obtained by false suggestion or misrepresentation I need to say a little more about the facts.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s270"">Following the examination of the application for the registration of the trade mark it appeared to the examiner that there were grounds for rejecting it.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s271"">On 29 June 2001 the Registrar wrote to Colorado Group advising it of those grounds (by providing it with a copy of the examiner's report) and giving it a reasonable time within which to address those grounds.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s272"">One issue raised by the examiner was that the trade mark was not distinctive.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s273"">Relevantly the examiner's report stated:",Sentence
" ""To be registrable, your trade mark must be capable of distinguishing your goods/services from the similar goods/services of other traders in the market place.</sentence>",Sentence

On 8 October 2002 Colorado Group provided the Registrar with additional information in support of its application.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s279"">After considering the additional information the Registrar accepted the application and, there being no opposition to its registration, the mark was registered with effect from the date of lodgement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s280"">38 The information provided to the Registrar, and upon which the Registrar presumably relied to grant registration, included a statement of Mr Williams made a year earlier.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s281"">When it provided the additional information Colorado Group was well aware of the activities of Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s282"">More importantly, it knew about the activities of Strandbags Group as at February 2001, which was the relevant time for the purpose of considering whether the trade mark was distinctive of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s283"">Colorado Group also appreciated that it had to provide some information to the Registrar about the use to which the word ""Colorado"" had been put by Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s284"">Mr Williams' statement dealt with that matter.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s285"">He said:",Sentence
" ""My recollection is that the first Colorado Bag Store opened in Sydney in 1990 or 1991.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s286"">This coincided with the introduction of the new Colorado logo.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s288"">",Sentence
" At the time Colorado Bag Co Store started in the market, the public was familiar with 'Colorado' as a brand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s289"">The brand had a reputation for quality built by the sale of its upmarket shoes.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s290"">At this time, the Colorado shoes had a minimum point of sale price of $60 and the $100 range of Colorado shoes was being sold in all stores.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s291"">The minimum $60 price was implemented to ensure that the Colorado brand was associated with quality.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s292"">""",Sentence
39 This was much less information about Strandbags Group's activities than was actually known to Colorado Group.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s293"">Partly for that reason it is said that Mr Williams' statement was misleading, and did in fact mislead the Registrar.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s294"">The statement is said to have been misleading in the following respects (and here I quote from Strandbags Group's submissions): ""(a) at least, as to the 2001 status of the Respondent's uses, and/or (b) very possibly, so as to think that there was some relationship between the trade mark applicant and the Colorado Bag Co."" As to (b) it is not being alleged that what was said was untrue (a direct misrepresentation) but, rather, that there was an implied or inferred representation to the effect that all that was known about Colorado Bag Co was being disclosed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s295"">Further, this is not a case of omission because an omission (if there be any) must render an actual statement false for it to be a misrepresentation: Arkwright v Newbold (1881) 17 Ch D 301, 309.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s296"">I propose to proceed on that view.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s297"">40 I do not accept that the Registrar would have read Mr Williams' statement as indicating that there was some relationship between Colorado Group and Colorado Bag Co.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s298"">The last sentence of the first quoted paragraph only makes sense if there were no relationship between the two.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s299"">The other alleged misrepresentation, however, cannot be dismissed out of hand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s300"">If what was said by Mr Williams would naturally lead the Registrar to suppose that Mr Williams had disclosed all that he knew about the activities of Colorado Bag Co he has made a representation to that effect: Lee v Jones (1864) 17 CB (NS) 482, 510.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s301"">In deciding what the Registrar would suppose, I am required to assume the Registrar is a reasonable person in that position: Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563, 576-577.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s302"">The view I take is that a reasonable Registrar would likely think that Mr Williams was providing him with information about the situation in 1991 and not as things stood in 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s303"">The first paragraph is in terms confined to events in 1991 -- ""The first Colorado Bag Store opened [in] 1990 or 1991"" -- ""At the time"" this was a cause for some concern but not a major concern because ""at that time"" the brand was characteristic of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s304"">The reference in the second paragraph to ""At the time"" and ""at that time"" likewise points the Registrar to 1990 or 1991.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s305"">In both paragraphs Mr Williams is making what he no doubt thought was an important point (whether it was or not being irrelevant), namely, that nothing of relevance happened after 1990 or 1991 because the mark had already acquired distinctiveness.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s306"">I do not accept that Mr Williams' statement would have been understood by the Registrar as referring to ""the 2001 status of [Strandbags Group's] uses.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s307"">""",Sentence
41 This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether the Registrar was in fact misled by any implied misrepresentation.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s308"">It goes without saying that it would have been near to impossible for this allegation to be made out in the absence of the Registrar, who was not called to give evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s309"">42 There is in any event a complete answer to the misrepresentation case that does not at all depend upon the meaning to be attributed to Mr Williams' statement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s310"">Even if Mr Williams had set out to deceive the Registrar, the point raised by the examiner was not a good point.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s311"">This is because I do not agree with the examiner (or therefore the Registrar) that the entitlement to registration depended upon satisfaction of s 45(5).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s312"">I have already explained that when used on shoes and backpacks the mark ""Colorado"" was inherently distinctive and that there was no need for evidence of use of the mark having acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s313"">Of course the Registrar was required to determine whether the word was used in a geographical sense, but that should have taken him along a different line of inquiry.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s314"">So, if there was misrepresentation which procured the registration of the mark, as a matter of law it was a misrepresentation about an irrelevant fact.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s315"">43 Turning to infringement, I will proceed on the basis that Colorado Group is the proprietor of the mark only in respect of backpacks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s316"">This is because in obtaining registration for goods other than backpacks and shoes Colorado Group cast its net too wide and, subject to what the parties may say about the imposition of conditions or the like, its mark should be taken off the register in relation to the goods or classes of goods for which it had not been used and which are not of the same kind as backpacks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s317"">On this basis, the question is whether Strandbags Group's use of the marks ""Colorado"" and ""Colorado Bag Co"" in relation to the sale of backpacks is the use of a mark that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the Colorado Group trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s318"">44 Applying the principles to be gathered from cases such as Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Limited [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407, 415, it is clear beyond any doubt that Strandbags Group's use of the word ""Colorado"" infringes the trade mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s319"">A defence under s 122(1)(f) was abandoned.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s320"">The facts will not support the defence under s 124.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s321"">This is not because (as was alleged) Edgarlodge is not Strandbags Group's predecessor in title (I am sure that it is having regard to the terms of the contract of sale), but because Edgarlodge's use of ""Colorado"" on backpacks was not a prior use.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s322"">45 This brings me to the passing off claim.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s323"">There is no dispute about the elements of the cause of action.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s324"">There is a very useful summary of the five elements by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd [1979] AC 731, 742.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s325"">Here the question is whether Colorado Group can make out goodwill and misrepresentation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s326"">To prove damage it is no longer necessary to show loss of sales or disparagement of goodwill.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s327"">It is enough if the exclusivity of the goodwill is eroded: Tattinger v Allbev Limited [1992] FSR 647; Irvine v Talkspot Ltd [2002] FSR 943.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s328"">Thus if goodwill and misrepresentation are established, damages will be proven.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s329"">The case was conducted on that basis.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s330"">46 Moving to the merits, I will begin by stating two principles.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s331"">The first is so elementary that it hardly needs stating.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s332"">The principle is this.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s333"">Statute and vicarious liability apart, A cannot bring an action against B to recover damages or secure other relief for an injury done by C. The second principle is that the relevant time for determining whether there has been a passing off is the date on which the impugned conduct commenced ( Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Ltd [1981] RPC 429; J C Penney Company Inc v Penneys Ltd [1975] FSR 367) or when the passing off was first threatened ( Barnsley Brewery Co Ltd v RBNB [1997] FSR 462), whichever is the earlier.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s334"">The combined effect of the two principles is that the time at which it is necessary to assess Colorado Group's claim in passing off is 21 September 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s335"">That is the day on which Strandbags Group completed the purchase of the Edgarlodge business and commenced its use of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s336"">The earlier activities of Edgarlodge cannot be the basis for relief against Strandbags.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s337"">47 The situation as at September 1998 was that Colorado Group had a substantial reputation in the Colorado brand throughout Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s338"">It had approximately 150 Williams the Shoemen and 120 Mathers stores selling Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s339"">The evidence does not show how many Colorado stores then existed but I know that by January 1999 (some three months later) there were 30 Colorado stores (up from 19 the previous year), 11 in New South Wales, 8 in Queensland, 3 in South Australia, 4 in Victoria, 1 in Western Australia, 2 in the Australian Capital Territory and 1 in the Northern Territory.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s340"">I will assume there were a few less as at September 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s341"">The total turnover of the Colorado division (that is, not including sales at Williams the Shoemen and Mathers stores) was approximately $17.15 million and $31.1 million in 1997 and 1998 respectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s342"">Advertising of Colorado products for the Colorado division was $315,000 in 1997 and $575,000 in 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s343"">If one has regard (as one should) to the sale of all Colorado products the approximate turnover in 1997 was $82.110 million and in 1998 it was $96.247 million, the total advertising costs in those years being $1.112 million and $1.347 million respectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s344"">48 Following its acquisition of the Edgarlodge business Strandbags Group also had a large operation selling Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s345"">It had acquired 25 stores, including 15 Colorado Bag Co stores that sold Colorado products.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s346"">The sale of Colorado products brought in $1,271,790 in 1997 and $2,086,218 in 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s347"">There can be no doubt that Strandbags Group also had a substantial reputation in the Colorado brand, largely centred around Queensland but not confined to that State.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s348"">49 It is worth observing, for it will become relevant in a moment, that in view of the substantial trade being done by Strandbags Group, it would have been surprising if this trade was not noticed by Colorado Group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s349"">And at least by 1990 or 1991 it had been noticed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s350"">In one of those years (it is not clear which) Mr Williams saw a Colorado Bag Co store in south Sydney, possibly the Liverpool store.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s351"">He said he was ""surprised at the name of the store"" but no action was taken by him or his employer.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s352"">Mr Beagley recalled in 1992 seeing a Bagstop shop in Brisbane where handbags marked ""Colorado"" were being sold.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s353"">In 1995 at the same shopping centre he saw a Colorado Bag Co store.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s354"">When asked why Colorado Group took no action about these activities Mr Beagley interestingly said: ""We did.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s355"">We went and looked at a lot of other trade mark registrations to try and, you know, sort of put a ring fence around Colorado and try and get more registrations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s356"">But you will note in my proposal [a reference to his earlier report suggesting the establishment of a Colorado chain] that there was concern about the vulnerability of the mark back in the early 90s.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s357"">""",Sentence
50 In 1995 Colorado Group conducted a business name search of Colorado Bag Co and discovered the proprietor.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s358"">There was then an exchange of correspondence between Colorado Group and Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s359"">The letters are privileged and hence were not produced.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s360"">I have, however, been given a letter dated 13 August 1998 from Edgarlodge to Colorado Group's attorneys.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s361"">It asserts that Colorado Group's use of the word ""Colorado"" infringed Edgarlodge's own trade mark, namely the Colorado with Indian head mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s362"">The letter also alleged that by using the word ""Colorado"", Colorado Group was infringing s 52 and was passing off its goods as being those of Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s363"">In response Colorado Group demanded that Edgarlodge cease selling goods by reference to the mark ""Colorado"" but said it could use its registered mark (being the Colorado with Indian head mark).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s364"">By that time, however, Strandbags Group was on the scene and the letter was passed on to its advisers.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s365"">They issued a denial of infringement and asserted that it was ""our client's customers who have been confused"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s366"">51 While I am on the topic of awareness it is also of some relevance to note that Mr Webb, the managing director of Colorado Group, not only knew of Edgarlodge's use of the ""Colorado"" mark but also Strandbags Group's use of the mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s367"">Mr Webb first found out about the use by Edgarlodge in September 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s368"">He knew at least by 2001 that Strandbags Group had taken over the Edgarlodge business and was making extensive use of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s369"">Indeed, in 2001 he met Mr Campbell, Strandbags Group's managing director, and discussed that use.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s370"">Nothing was resolved.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s371"">The two met again in April 2004.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s372"">At that meeting Mr Webb foreshadowed the institution of this proceeding, indicating that the previous period of ""co-existence"" could not continue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s373"">52 Now, coming back to September 1998, the position was this.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s374"">At that time both Colorado Group and Strandbags Group had a reputation in the name Colorado.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s375"">I rather think that if one were to go back to the 1980s when Williams the Shoemen's use of the name was confined to backpacks and shoes it and Edgarlodge occupied different fields of trade and it is unlikely, except for those consumers who were careless, that confusion would arise.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s376"">By the time the companies' fields of activity began to overlap (that is when Colorado Group was opening its Colorado stores and Edgarlodge was operating its Colorado Bag Co stores) there was the potential for confusion.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s377"">In the early years the different locations in which the parties operated would suggest that any confusion would not be substantial.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s378"">Moreover, the fact that Colorado Group's combination mark (word and mountain logo) was different from Edgarlodge's combination mark (word with Indian head) would also minimise the possibility of confusion.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s379"">53 Whatever be the position in the years leading up to 1998, from the time Strandbags Group purchased the Edgarlodge business both it and Colorado Group had a strong reputation in the Colorado brand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s380"">I think this finding must put an end to the passing off claim.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s381"">In a trade mark case General Electric Co of USA v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729, 743, Lord Diplock said: ""In cases of honest concurrent user [and Strandbags Group's use is concurrent], neither of the owners of [a common law trade mark] could restrict the other from using it, but as against a usurper who infringed it either owner of the mark could obtain an injunction"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s382"">In a passing off case when two traders have a reputation in the same or similar names that are concurrently being used ""neither of them can be said to be guilty of any misrepresentation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s383"">Each represents nothing but the truth, that a particular name or mark is associated with his goods or business"": Habib Bank Ltd v Habib Bank AG Zurich [1981] 1 WLR 1265, 1275 per Oliver LJ.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s384"">If in such circumstances there might be confusion that is just ""one of the misfortunes which occur in life"", but it is not actionable as a passing off: Marengo v Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic Ltd [1992] FSR 1, 2.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s385"">54 For the sake of completeness I should mention that Colorado Group did not in the action pursue a claim that Strandbags Group should be restricted in the use of its ""Colorado"" mark to a particular geographic area (for example, Queensland) or to particular kinds of goods (say, handbags).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s386"">There are many cases where a party using a mark has been restrained from extending its use in a way that will encroach upon the established reputation of a competitor either in a particular geographical area or in a particular line of business.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s387"">I mention this not to suggest that the pursuit of such a claim could have provided the applicants with some relief, but simply to show that the point has not been overlooked.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s388"">55 The claim under s 52 must fail for the same reason as the passing off claim has failed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s389"">Although a s 52 claim may succeed where a passing off claim has failed ( Peter Isaacson Publications v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1984) 3 IPR 255), when, as here, there has been no misrepresentation, the s 52 claim cannot succeed: Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s390"">By the time Strandbags Group took over the Edgarlodge business the point had been reached where the court could not interfere with that company's trading even if in the past there had been misleading conduct engaged in by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s391"">It is possible that prior to the sale Colorado Group could have taken action to restrain Edgarlodge's activities.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s392"">Having failed to take that action, it cannot now complain about what is being done by Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s393"">56 Several aspects of the case remain to be dealt with because as is usual in this kind of litigation there was a split between issues concerning liability and those concerned with remedies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s394"">I will hear from the parties on what should now be done.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s1"">2 The first proceeding to be commenced was NSD 1120 of 2005 ('the revocation proceeding'), between Alphapharm Pty Ltd ('Alphapharm') as applicant and the present applicant, H Lundbeck A/S ('Lundbeck'), as respondent.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s2"">In that proceeding, Alphapharm seeks a declaration that claims 1 --- 6 of Lundbeck's Australian Patent No 623144 ('the Patent') are invalid and an order that they be revoked, or, in the alternative, an order that the Register of Patents ('the Register') be rectified pursuant to s 192 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ('the Act') to remove an extension of the term of the Patent from the Register.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s12"">Alphapharm contends that the consequence of the alleged error is that the extension was invalidly granted and that all reference to it should be removed from the Register, whereas the Commissioner contends that the consequence is only that the entry reflects an excessively long extension, and that the Register should be amended only so as to refer to a shorter period.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s53"">Lundbeck's request for the extension was filed on 22 December 2003.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s54"">The pharmaceutical substance the subject of the Patent is the S-enantiomer of the compound Citalopram.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s55"">In its application for the extension, Lundbeck represented that the first goods included on the ARTG containing or consisting of this pharmaceutical substance was Lundbeck's product which bears the brand name, LEXAPRO.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s56"">LEXAPRO had been included on the ARTG only since 16 September 2003.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s57"">According to Mallesons' letter, however, the first product included in the ARTG containing the S-enantiomer of Citalopram was citalopram hydrobromide, which was registered by Lundbeck under the brand name, CIPRAMIL.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s58"">Mallesons' letter claimed that CIPRAMIL had been included in the ARTG since 20 November 1997.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s59"">In fact the correct date was 9 December 1997, but nothing turns on this discrepancy.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s60"">Alphapharm's contention is that 9 December 1997 was the date of the first inclusion in the ARTG of goods that contained the pharmaceutical substance, the S-enantiomer of Citalopram, because, according to the letter, CIPRAMIL comprises the S-enantiomer of Citalopram and the R-enantiomer of Citalopram.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s61"">11 Section 70 of the Act provides for applications for an extension of the term of standard patents relating to pharmaceutical substances.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s62"">One condition which must be satisfied in relation to at least one of the pharmaceutical substances disclosed in the complete specification falling within the scope of the claim or claims, is that the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on the first regulatory approval date for the substance is at least five years: s 70(3)(b).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s63"">For this purpose, the expression 'first regulatory approval date' in relation to a pharmaceutical substance is defined in s 70(5).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s64"">Paragraph (a) of that subsection has the effect that if, as here, no pre-TGA marketing approval was given in relation to the substance, the first regulatory approval date is the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the ARTG of goods that 'contain, or consist of' the substance.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s65"">At the heart of the dispute is whether Lundbeck's product CIPRAMIL satisfies that description.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s66"">If so, the first regulatory approval date is 9 December 1997, rather than 16 September 2003.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s67"">12 The period from the date of the Patent (13 June 1989) to 9 December 1997 is eight years, five months and twenty-six days.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s69"">Accordingly, whichever of the competing contentions as to the 'first regulatory approval date' is correct, Lundbeck's application for the extension of term satisfied s 70(3)(b), because each of the periods is a period of at least five years.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s8"">5 The appellant is a plumber by trade, and became bankrupt as a consequence of a sequestration order made against his estate by the Federal Court Queensland District Registry on 2 September 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s9"">Messrs Philip Gregory Jefferson and Jay Arscott Stevenson were appointed trustees in bankruptcy of the appellant's estate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s10"">Mr Stevenson was subsequently replaced by Mr Gerald Collins as trustee in 2000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s11"">Messrs Jefferson and Collins are currently the trustees in bankruptcy of the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s12"">The replacement of Mr Stevenson as trustee by Mr Collins in 2000 is not relevant to the matter before this Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s13"">Almost all formal communications from the trustees to the appellant were from Mr Jefferson.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s14"">6 A statement of affairs is required to be completed and filed by a bankrupt pursuant to s 54(1) Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s15"">This section provides:",Sentence
" '(1) Where a sequestration order is made, the person against whose estate it is made shall, within 14 days from the day on which he or she is notified of the bankruptcy:",Sentence
 (a) make out and file with the Official Receiver for the District in which the sequestration order was made a statement of his or her affairs; and,Sentence
 (b) furnish a copy of the statement to the trustee.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s16"">",Sentence
 Penalty: 5 penalty units',Sentence
7 Section 149 Bankruptcy Act provides that a bankrupt is discharged at the end of the period of three years from the date on which the bankrupt filed his or her statement of affairs .</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s17"">It therefore follows that it is of utmost importance from the point of view of any bankrupt, including the appellant, for the purposes of facilitating prompt discharge from bankruptcy at the end of three years, that the statement of affairs be filed as soon as possible.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s18"">8 On 8 September 1998 Mr Matthew Joiner attended the appellant at the appellant's premises in Gumdale in suburban Brisbane.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s19"">Subject to the supervision of the trustees, Mr Joiner was responsible for the day to day administration of the appellant's bankrupt estate.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s20"">During the course of the attendance, Mr Joiner delivered to the appellant a bundle of documents including:",Sentence
 (a) a Notice informing the appellant that,Sentence
(i) he had been made bankrupt by a sequestration order on 2 September 1998;,Sentence
(ii) Messrs Jefferson and Stevenson were the trustees of his bankrupt estate;,Sentence
"(iii) within 14 days he was required to make out and file a statement of affairs, a copy of which was enclosed with the Notice, with the Official Receiver and to furnish the trustees with a copy of the statement;",Sentence
(iv) the term of his bankruptcy would commence once the duly completed statement of affairs was lodged with the Official Receiver.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s21"">This particular point was emphasised in the Notice, being in bold uppercase lettering at the bottom of the first page of the Notice; and",Sentence
"(v) while it was his responsibility to lodge the statement of affairs, the trustees were prepared to lodge it on his behalf if he wished.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s22"">",Sentence
 (b) a letter enclosing,Sentence
"(i) a sealed copy of the sequestration order made against his estate,",Sentence
"(ii) a Notice entitled 'Warning Some Responsibilities of a Bankrupt' (which noted the time requirements relevant to filing the statement of affairs, and the penalties incurred in default of filing the document),",Sentence
"(iii) requirement for funds to be deposited with the trustees in accordance with s 161B Bankruptcy Act , and",Sentence
 (c) a letter enclosing a number of questionnaires to be completed by the appellant dealing with his personal and financial affairs.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s23"">",Sentence
"9 On 14 September 1998 there were two conversations between the appellant and Mr Joiner involving discussions of the administration of the appellant's bankrupt estate, and the financial affairs of the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s24"">The appellant on that date faxed a letter to Mr Joiner requesting Mr Joiner ' to apply to the Official Receiver and the Law Courts of Australia for an extension of time regarding the filling (sic) out the Statement of Affairs and any other paper work regarding this matter '.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s25"">The appellant stated that he required at least one calendar month to do so from the date of the letter.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s26"">10 Mr Jefferson responded in a letter dated 15 September 1998, advising the appellant, inter alia , that the Bankruptcy Act did not allow the trustee to grant further time to complete the statement of affairs beyond the fourteen days set out in subs 54(1) of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">In the letter, the trustee confirmed the advice of Mr Joiner that the period of bankruptcy would not commence until the statement of affairs was filed with the Official Receiver, and confirmed that the trustee's office was willing to assist the appellant with promptly completing his statement of affairs and questionnaires, and collating his personal and business books and records.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">11 Mr Joiner attended on the appellant on 21 September 1998 for the purpose of collecting documents including a statement of affairs (the '1998 Statement of Affairs').</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">12 The statement of affairs as signed by the appellant, and collected by Mr Joiner on 21 September 1998, was clearly deficient in relation to the information required.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">13 In evidence before this Court, the appellant indicated that he had become frustrated inserting information into the form, and for that reason had chosen not to insert information beyond that he had included in Pt A of the form.</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s32"">15 According to Mr Joiner's evidence, the Official Receiver refused to accept delivery of the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998, and the rejected document was returned to Mr Joiner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s33"">Mr Joiner also gave evidence that the member of his firm's staff who delivered the appellant's originally signed statement of affairs informed him that the Official Receiver refused to accept delivery of the statement of affairs on the basis that the statement had not been satisfactorily completed (Affidavit of Matthew Leslie Joiner sworn 18 March 2005, par 18).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s34"">Interestingly, this may be compared with evidence of the Deputy Official Receiver sworn by affidavit on 17 March 2005 that ITSA rejected the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 10 February 1999 , and returned it to the trustees and did not retain a copy (Affidavit of Robert George Siemon sworn 17 March 2005, par 13).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s35"">I shall deal with this point later in the judgment.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s36"">16 The trustees returned the 1998 Statement of Affairs to the appellant by mail on 15 February 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s37"">As noted by the learned Federal Magistrate, no explanation for the delay in returning the form to the appellant has been proffered.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s38"">The letter from the trustee enclosing the 1998 Statement of Affairs stated simply it had not been accepted by the Official Receiver as it had not been properly completed, and requesting that a further statement of affairs enclosed with the letter be completed and returned to the trustee.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s39"">The trustee invited the appellant to contact Mr Joiner if the appellant encountered difficulty properly completing the statement of affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s40"">17 It appears that the appellant did not respond to the letter of 15 February 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s41"">The appellant's postal address was a post office box at Gumdale.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s42"">Mr Joiner gave evidence that he rang Gumdale Post Office on 10 May 1999 and confirmed that mail from the appellant's post office box was being collected daily.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s43"">18 The trustee wrote to the appellant again on 12 May 1999, referring to his letter of 15 February 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s44"">The appellant responded by letter dated 17 May 1999, denying receipt of the letter of 15 February 1999, and requesting that any communications with him be by telephone.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s45"">19 The appellant gave evidence both before the Federal Magistrate and before this Court that he had been in dispute with his wife at the relevant time; that his wife also had access to the post office box at Gumdale; and that it is possible that his wife had taken possession of mail addressed to him including correspondence from the trustees.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s46"">20 There appears to have been another telephone conversation between Mr Joiner and the appellant on 30 June 1999 where the 1998 Statement of Affairs was discussed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s47"">This conversation was followed by a letter from the trustee to the appellant on 7 July 1999, asking the appellant to address the issues raised in the trustee's letter of 15 February 1999, and informing the appellant that, as the Official Receiver had not accepted the 1998 Statement of Affairs in the form executed by the appellant, the three year period of the bankruptcy had yet to commence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s48"">The trustees also enclosed another statement of affairs form for completion by the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s49"">A short telephone conversation took place between Mr Joiner and the appellant on 9 July 1999 where it appears that the appellant was verbally abusive of Mr Joiner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s50"">21 The trustees wrote again to the appellant at his Gumdale postal address on 30 March 2000, requesting written responses to the information sought in the letters of 15 February 1999 and 7 July 1999, seeking information about earnings of the appellant, and reminding the appellant that, as he had not yet provided a properly completed statement of affairs, the three year period of bankruptcy had not yet commenced.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s51"">It appears that there was no response from the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s52"">22 On 30 March 2001, ITSA wrote to the trustees inquiring about, inter alia , the absence of a filed copy of a statement of affairs completed by the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s53"">The trustees responded to ITSA on 8 May 2001, including summarising the history of correspondence between the trustees and the appellant, and informing ITSA that the trustees continued to hold an incomplete copy of the statement of affairs (namely, the 1998 Statement of Affairs).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s54"">23 On 20 July 2004, the trustees wrote to ITSA informing ITSA that the trustees had been unable to obtain a completed statement of affairs from the bankrupt.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s55"">The trustees requested ITSA to execute a Notice pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act to be issued to the appellant, requiring the appellant to attend before the Official Receiver and produce, inter alia , a completed statement of affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s56"">24 A Notice executed pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act was executed by the Deputy Official Receiver on 29 July 2004, requiring the appellant to appear for examination at the offices of the trustees on 17 August 2004.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s57"">The notice was not served on the appellant until 12 August 2004, for the reason that the appellant appears to have changed address without advising the trustees of his new address.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s58"">The appellant requested a postponement of the examination pursuant to s 77C scheduled for 17 August 2004.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s59"">It appears that no consent was given by ITSA to the postponement of the examination, however the appellant did not attend at the scheduled time.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s60"">25 It appears from evidence of the Deputy Official Receiver that another time was set for an examination pursuant to s 77C , however the appellant again indicated that he would not be able to attend, and requested the examination be rescheduled.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s61"">26 The appellant lodged a fresh statement of affairs on 2 February 2005.</sentence>",Sentence

" (a) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Official Receiver of ITSA rejected the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998, when the evidence of the Official Receiver is that the 1998 Statement of Affairs was rejected and returned to the trustees on 10 February 1999 (encompassing ground 1 and 7 in the notice of appeal); (b) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the appellant did not have a reasonable basis after 9 July 1999 for believing that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been accepted by the Official Receiver, and further that his Honour erred in not finding that the appellant did not know of the non-acceptance of the 1998 Statement of Affairs until the appellant was contacted by ITSA in 2004 (encompassing grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 in the notice of appeal); (c) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that, in contrast with the appellant's statement of affairs filed with and accepted by ITSA on 2 February 2005, the defects in the 1998 Statement of Affairs were so significant that the document was not a statement of affairs at all (encompassing grounds 9 and 10 in the notice of appeal); and (d) the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to exercise his discretion in favour of the appellant, despite the fact that the Federal Magistrate found that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been completed to the best of the appellant's ability, and, in this regard, erred in failing to find that the appellant was unable to obtain a Building Services Authority licence as a plumber while remaining an undischarged bankrupt (encompassing grounds 11, 12 and 13 in the notice of appeal).</sentence>",Sentence

 GROUND (a): DATE OF REJECTION OF STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS,Sentence
"33 As discussed earlier in this judgment, Mr Joiner's evidence was that the Official Receiver refused to accept delivery of the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998, and the rejected document was returned to Mr Joiner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s88"">This is at odds with evidence of the Deputy Official Receiver that ITSA rejected the statement of affairs on 10 February 1999, and returned it to the trustees on that date.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s89"">34 Unfortunately this confusion was not resolved during the appeal.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s90"">In light of the fact that the appellant's bankruptcy would not commence until he had successfully filed a statement of affairs with the Official Receiver of ITSA, it was clearly important that the 1998 Statement of Affairs be dealt with promptly by ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s91"">If, as indicated by Mr Joiner's affidavit, ITSA had immediately rejected the 1998 Statement of Affairs, it was very important that a rejection of the form have been communicated forthwith to the appellant by the trustees to allow the appellant to immediately re-execute and re-submit a statement of affairs to ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s92"">Either way, a five month delay is not timely in any sense, given the importance of prompt filing of the statement of affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s93"">35 However, two issues are:",Sentence
" (a) whether on the facts of this case it makes any difference whether the 1998 Statement of Affairs was rejected on 23 September 1998 or on 10 February 1999, and (b) whether the failure of the trustees to advise the appellant of the rejection of the 1998 Statement of Affairs until 10 February 1999 is determinative of the outcome of this case, in view of the relevant law and events after 10 February 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s94"">",Sentence
The answer to both questions is negative.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">The reason is that, both before the learned Federal Magistrate and on appeal before this Court, this case turns on the application of s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">Whether the Official Receiver refused to accept the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998 or on 10 February 1999 is relevant only to the reasonable belief of the appellant, and the exercise of the discretion of the Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">These issues are considered further in this judgment.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">Accordingly, ground (a) of the appeal is rejected.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">GROUND (b): REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE 1998 STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED",Sentence
"36 To enliven the jurisdiction of the Court under s 33A Bankruptcy Act , the Court must find that the person believed, on reasonable grounds, that the statement of affairs had already been filed at a time before it was actually filed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s100"">The Federal Magistrate found that between 23 September 1998 and 9 July 1999, the appellant believed that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been filed, however after 9 July 1999 the appellant knew that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted by ITSA; and that even if the appellant had held that belief after 9 July 1999, it would not have been reasonable for him to hold that belief.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s101"">37 As I noted earlier, s 33A Bankruptcy Act is a relatively recent amendment to the legislation, introduced by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s102"">The explanatory memorandum is of little assistance in interpreting the section, simply noting in par 78:",Sentence
" 'The effect of this new section is to allow the Court to order that a statement of affairs be treated as having been filed at a time before it was actually filed, provided that the Court is satisfied that the bankrupt believed, on reasonable grounds, that this statement had been filed at a time before it actually was filed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">Proposed subs 33A(3) allows a period of grace of 30 days before the order can take effect to allow the trustee to disengage from the role of trustee.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">By transitional provision item 204, the change will apply to statements of affairs filed at any time, whether before or after commencement.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">'",Sentence
38 There are few cases where this section has been discussed.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">Counsel for the respondent helpfully referred me to two decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court where s 33A was applied, namely Chronis v DS Queen Street Mall Pty Ltd [2004] FMCA 1107 , and Sobey v Duncan [2005] FMCA 1170.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">These cases are interesting as examples of fact situations which have practically arisen in relation to filing of Statements of Affairs, where Federal Magistrates applied s 33A to backdate the filing date of a statement of affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s108"">In both cases, the bankrupts had reasonably believed that their completed Statements of Affairs had been filed with the Official Receiver at a certain date, and had, on learning that the Statements of Affairs had not been filed at the time they had understood, had sought an order of the Court under s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s109"">In both cases, an order was given altering the filing date of the statement of affairs pursuant to s 33A.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">39 In the absence of communication from the trustees that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been rejected by ITSA, it was reasonable for the appellant to believe that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been accepted by ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">However, while there appears to have been some difficulty of communication with the appellant by mail, I am satisfied, as was his Honour, that by no later than 9 July 1999 the appellant knew that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted by or filed with ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">40 Indeed, in my view the conclusion could be drawn that the appellant was aware by 30 June 1999 that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">It was on this date that Mr Joiner and the appellant engaged in a telephone conversation where it appears that that the appellant was angry primarily because the appellant's statement of affairs had not been accepted by ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">However I am content not to disturb his Honour's finding on this issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">41 I reject the submissions of the appellant that he had not become aware of the rejection of the statement of affairs until early 2004 when he received a formal notice pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act from ITSA, and that he could have reasonably held the belief after 9 July 1999 that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been successfully filed with ITSA on 23 August 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">42 On the basis that the learned Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had reasonably believed, until 9 July 1999, that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been filed, the question remains whether the subsequent sequence of events means that, on the basis of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court made in 2005, it was open to the Court to make an order effectively backdating the filing date of the statement of affairs, executed in 2005, to 1998.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">43 In my view, it was not open.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">On the facts of this case as outlined earlier in this judgment, it is clear that several years had passed between the attempted filing of the 1998 Statement of Affairs, and the actual filing of a statement of affairs by the appellant in 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">During this time the appellant had no basis on which to reasonably believe, and indeed knew, that the document he had submitted for filing in 1998 had not been accepted by the Official Receiver of ITSA.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">In my respectful view, the section does not contemplate a bankrupt being aware for several years that his or her statement of affairs has not been accepted for filing because it was defective, and then claiming that he or she had, temporarily, a reasonable belief several years before making application to the Court, that the statement of affairs had been filed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">In my view, knowledge of this kind does not accord with 'reasonable belief' within the meaning of s 33A(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">44 On the evidence before me I am satisfied that his Honour was correct in the findings he made at first instance.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">Accordingly, ground (b) of the appeal is rejected.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">GROUND (c): DEFECTS IN THE 1998 STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS",Sentence
45 The result of rejection of ground (b) of the appeal means that the jurisdiction of the Court is not enlivened under s 33A(2).</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">However, even if the Appellant had sought an order from the Court upon learning that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been rejected in July 1999, in my view the appellant would not have been assisted by s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">The reason for this is that, as found by the learned Federal Magistrate, the defects in the 1998 Statement of Affairs were so significant that it could not be said that the document was a statement of affairs at all.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">Further, his Honour found that the defects could not be described as 'formal' or 'irregularities' for the purposes of s 306 Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">46 The form and content of a statement of affairs for the purposes of s 54(1) Bankruptcy Act is prescribed by s 6A(2) which states:",Sentence

 This clearly means a bankrupt is required to:,Sentence
" (a) make out and file with the Official Receiver a statement of affairs in the form approved by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and published in the Commonwealth Gazette from time to time (as required by s 6A) , and (b) because the required statement is a statement of the bankrupt's affairs: complete that form with personal information as required by the form.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">",Sentence
"Obviously, it would not satisfy s 54(1) for a bankrupt to seek to file a blank statement of affairs in the form approved by the Inspector-General without including the personal information required by the form, because then the form would not be a statement of the bankrupt's personal affairs as required by the section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">48 The significance of the statement of affairs was explained by Hill J in Nilant v Macchia [2000] FCA 1528 ; (2000) 104 FCR 238 at 245, [2000] FCA 1528 ; 178 ALR 371 at 377 where his Honour said:",Sentence
" 'The obligation to file a statement of affairs in a public register is intended to make information concerning the bankrupt's affairs available to creditors and, for that matter, members of the public.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">The former may inspect without payment of a fee, the latter only on payment of a fee.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">But it is in the interests of the public in the encouragement of morality in trading that the financial situation of a bankrupt debtor be open to inspection.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">Because, ordinarily, the administration of the estate and ultimate distribution of dividends from the estate, will be dependent upon the trustee having full details of the trade dealings and debts of a debtor, the statement is to be made available as well to the trustee in bankruptcy.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">'",Sentence
"49 The appellant has confined his argument to the finding of his Honour that the document attempted by the appellant was so defective as not to be a 'statement of affairs', and has submitted that his Honour was in error in so finding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">The appellant has not submitted that s 306(1) is applicable in relation to the 1998 Statement of Affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">50 Although there are a number of decisions of this Court considering issues raised by defective statements of affairs under s 54(1) Bankruptcy Act , most commonly in this context the Court has been asked to consider the application of s 306(1) Bankruptcy Act to cure irregularities in statements of affairs.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">The leading case in this context is Nilant v Macchia , cited earlier, which considered, inter alia , whether failure to comply with s 54(1) gave rise to a 'proceeding' under the Bankruptcy Act capable of being brought before the Court.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">The appellant before me has not sought to rely on s 306 in this case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">Nonetheless comments by the court in Nilant v Macchia , which deals with both s 54(1) and s 306(1) , are, by analogy, apposite to the circumstances of this case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">In particular, Weinberg J at ALR 383-384 noted:",Sentence
" 'Where there has been an attempt to comply with the obligations of s 54(1) , whether within the 14-day period specified, or on some occasion thereafter, it is entirely apt to speak of that attempt as being a ""proceeding under this Act"", and as being capable of being regarded by the court as 'not invalidated' by reason of any formal defect or error....It follows that the bankruptcy will not continue for an unconscionably long period merely because of some relatively minor failure on the part of the bankrupt to comply with the strict requirements of s 54(1)",Sentence
" (384) Regrettably, it seems to me that s 306(1) cannot be invoked in the circumstances of the present case, where no step whatever has been taken by the bankrupt in purported compliance with the requirements of s 54(1).... ' (emphasis added)",Sentence
51 An examination of the 1998 Statement of Affairs reveals that very little of the document was genuinely attempted by the appellant.</sentence>,Sentence

"<sentence id=""s192"">It seems clear that, despite repeated attempts of the trustees to explain the position to him, the appellant chose to ignore this advice, or obstinately refused to co-operate on the basis that he had already provided the 1998 Statement of Affairs, and he was prepared to do no more.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">67 The appellant also strongly argued that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that, the appellant, while a bankrupt, could not obtain a Building Services Authority licence as a plumber while remaining an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">I understand from statements of the appellant during the appeal hearing that a consequence of the lack of a licence is that he cannot practice as a self-employed plumber, although he can practise his trade as an employee.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">68 Minimal evidence was lead in this regard, although I understand that the Queensland Building Services Authority publishes financial requirements for licensing which must be met by applicants for a licence under the Queensland Building Services Authority Act 1991 (Qld).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s196"">69 Notwithstanding the lack of evidence before me on this issue, it is possible that the appellant is correct in his submission concerning his inability to hold a Building Services Authority licence while he is an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">However, it is also possible that, given the appellant's current financial situation, he would be unable to satisfy financial requirements necessary to obtain a licence if he were discharged from bankruptcy forthwith.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">In the absence of any relevant information before me, I make no finding on this issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">70 In my view, whether or not the appellant would be able to obtain a Building Services Authority licence were he to be discharged from bankruptcy forthwith is only relevant in the case before me to the extent that it goes to whether the learned Federal Magistrate should have exercised his discretion under s 33A in the appellant's favour.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">71 Given the lack of co-operation of the appellant in this matter with the trustees, and his views towards completing a statement of affairs in a form capable of being filed until 2005, no evidence has been lead before me which persuades me that the Federal Magistrate was in error in failing to exercise his discretion in favour of the appellant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">Accordingly, ground (d) of the appeal is rejected.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">APPLICATION OF SECTION 33A TO THE FACTS",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s3"">He first travelled to Australia in about 1960.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s4"">He stayed in Australia for several years during which time he was convicted, on two separate occasions, of the offences of ""play unlawful game (banker)"" and ""steal from a person"" for which he was sentenced to two months imprisonment fully suspended and a term of imprisonment of four years respectively.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s5"">3 In 1965 the applicant returned to New Zealand and remained there for seven years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s6"">He married his present wife in 1967 and she has borne him two children.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s7"">He was convicted of minor offences in New Zealand in 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s8"">In 1969 or 1970 the applicant passed through Australia on a journey from New Zealand to the United States.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s9"">4 The applicant gave evidence at the hearing that he cannot recall precisely when he returned to Australia to live in Sydney but that he travelled to Australia once only and that his family followed a matter of weeks later.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s10"">Records kept by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (""the Department"") indicate that a ""John Joseph Moran"" arrived on May 24 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s11"">However, the applicant's wife and sons deposed that they travelled to Australia with the applicant and arrived on 28 January 1973.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s12"">The applicant and his family have resided in Australia since their arrival.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s13"">The applicant's wife and sons have become Australian citizens.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s14"">5 In 1978 the applicant was convicted of ""stealing s501 (retail store)"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s15"">The sentence was recorded as ""sentence if call on 3 years begin 16/12/1978"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s16"">6 The Department's movement records indicate that the applicant left Australia on 4 March 1984 for a vacation in Thailand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s17"">(On being shown Departmental records, the applicant conceded that it had been early in March and not late February as asserted in his affidavit, that he had left for Thailand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s18"">) On his return to Sydney Airport the applicant was not permitted to re-enter Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s19"">7 Having been refused entry to Australia at Sydney Airport, the applicant purchased a ticket and travelled to New Zealand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s20"">He later returned to Australia on a merchant vessel of unknown name which berthed in Hobart.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s21"">The applicant then immediately returned to Sydney.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s22"">(In his affidavit, the applicant deposed to having returned by boat within a matter of weeks.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s23"">However, at the hearing he gave evidence that his return had occurred within days explaining that he had not read the affidavit properly.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s24"">) Although unsure of the various dates, the applicant was adamant that he had returned to Australia before 2 April 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s25"">He gave evidence at the hearing that he had determined this by calculating backwards from the date on which he was shown to have left Australia knowing that he had spent between seven and eight days in Thailand and three to five days in New Zealand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s26"">It apparently takes merchant ships three days to travel between New Zealand and Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">8 Between his return to Australia in 1984 and April 1999 the applicant was convicted of two minor offences.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">Then, on 19 April 1999, he was charged with offences of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug and cultivating an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s29"">He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a minimum term to be served of 12 months.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s30"">9 By letter dated 8 June 2000 the applicant was given notice of intention to cancel his visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s31"">Detailed submissions were made on behalf of the applicant in response to that notice.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s32"">10 The applicant was released from prison on 5 December 2000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s33"">On 15 December 2000 the Minister cancelled his visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s34"">The applicant was taken into immigration detention on 31 January 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s35"">He did not challenge the decision to cancel his visa and left Australia for New Zealand on 17 February 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s36"">He then returned to Australia by ship travelling to Brisbane and resumed living in Sydney where he was reunited with his family.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s37"">11 On 20 November 2003 the applicant was arrested in Bendigo and charged with involvement in further drug offences.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s38"">He was denied bail.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s39"">12 On 23 April 2004 the applicant was informed that he was also being detained as a suspected unlawful non-citizen.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s40"">In relation to the drug offences with which he had been charged, he was sentenced on 18 February 2005 to be imprisoned for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s41"">The applicant claims that, taking into account the period during which he had been imprisoned before sentence, the non-parole period expired on 8 May 2005 and he has been solely in immigration detention since that date.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s42"">On the other hand, it is asserted on behalf of the Minister that, having declined to apply for parole, the applicant continues to serve the sentence imposed on 18 February 2005.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s43"">The Minister's decision",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">He had lived in Australia between 1960 and 1964 and returned to live in this country on 24 May 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">In the applicant's submission, those periods of residence in combination demonstrate a commitment to reside in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">It was further contended that his eight year absence from Australia between 1964 and 1972 did not preclude him from being an absorbed person as he had, since 1960, lived in Australia for sixteen out of the total of 24 years between 1960 and 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">44 The applicant's intention to reside permanently in Australia from 1972 was said to have been corroborated by the fact that his wife and children had joined him in Australia in 1972 and, moreover, had become permanent Australian residents on 2 April 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">They are now Australian citizens.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">The applicant also pointed to the fact that, throughout his periods of residence in Australia, he has been employed in the racing industry.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">His contribution to that industry was said to demonstrate a commitment to community activity in this country.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">In relation to economic ties, including property in this country, the applicant submitted that he has not acquired property in Australia because of insufficient income.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">It was submitted that this factor is not fatal to a finding that the applicant is an absorbed person.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s147"">45 For the purposes of considering the applicant's criminal record, the relevant date was said to be 2 April 1984 which is stipulated in s 34(2)(b) of the Act because, in the applicant's submission, he ceased to be subject to the Act after that date.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s148"">Accordingly, it was said, any convictions thereafter are not relevant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s149"">Prior convictions in New Zealand were similarly said to be irrelevant to whether the applicant has been absorbed into the Australian community.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s150"">46 Consequently, the applicant contended that his status as an absorbed person should be determined solely by reference to convictions in 1960, 1964 and February 1978.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s151"">It was submitted that the first two convictions of ""play unlawful game (banker)"" and ""steal from a person"" had been recorded more than 20 years before the relevant date and were not sufficient on their own to preclude a finding that the applicant has been ""absorbed"", particularly when weighed against his family circumstances and the length of time that has elapsed since his most serious conviction in 1964.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s152"">47 The applicant contended that, for the purposes of determining whether he had left Australia on or after 2 April 1984, the critical date is 1 September 1994 and any subsequent departure (such as the purported removal on 17 February 2001) is not relevant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s153"">Consequently, it was contended, the applicant is not a person who had left Australia within the meaning of s 34(2)(c) of the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s154"">48 The applicant further submitted that he was not precluded by s 34(2)(d) from obtaining an absorbed person visa as he was not a person to whom s 20 of the old Act applied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s155"">Section 20 set out the circumstances in which non-citizens might become illegal entrants.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s156"">In particular, s 20(2)(d) provided that a non-citizen might become an illegal entrant where, on any occasion on which the person had entered Australia, he or she had been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of at least one year; (see [ 31 ] of these reasons).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s157"">49 The applicant acknowledged that, as outlined at [ 32 ] and [ 33 ] above, an entry permit was taken to be cancelled when a person became an illegal entrant by the operation of ss 20(1) and 14 (2) of the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s158"">However, it was contended that, before 1 September 1994, New Zealand citizens had been exempt from the requirement in s 14(1) that a non-citizen hold a valid entry permit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s159"">Consequently, so the argument went, s 20 did not address the circumstances of New Zealanders for whom s 16 made special provision by providing;",Sentence
 ' Minister may declare exempt non-citizens to be undesirable,Sentence
" The Minister may, in writing, declare in relation to an exempt non-citizen that it is undesirable that the exempt non-citizen be permitted to enter Australia or to remain in Australia'",Sentence
"50 It was further submitted that, notwithstanding the purported retrospective operation of s 20(1) , it cannot be construed to apply to the applicant's return to Australia on 24 May 1972 which occurred under an entirely different statutory regime.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s160"">As well as producing an absurd result, that construction, it was contended, would work an injustice because the applicant could not have known, when he departed from Australia in 1965, what consequences would be attached to that departure by an enactment that did not commence until June 1989.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s161"">51 On behalf of the applicant it was acknowledged that the further sentence which he received in February in 1978 had been imposed in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s162"">Nevertheless, it was submitted, his return to Hobart in March 1984 was not otherwise affected by s 20(1) of the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s163"">As well, it was contended that reg 17(1)(c)(v) of the Transitional Regulations (reproduced at [ 33 ] above) invalidly seeks to deny the legal effect of the applicant's alleged absorbed person status.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s164"">That contention seems, however, to be erected on a misunderstanding of reg 17.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s165"">The regulation, I consider, operated to deem a non-citizen to have been granted a special category visa if the non-citizen was not taken to hold an absorbed person visa or one of the other visas specified in reg 17(1)(c)(iii) or (iv).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s166"">It is therefore unnecessary, in my view, to consider further the applicant's submissions on this issue.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s167"">52 For the applicant it was contended that, as an absorbed person when, on 2 April 1984, the Act came to be founded on the aliens power, he had ceased to be amenable to Parliament's authority to make laws with respect to immigration.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s168"">Accordingly, the submission proceeded, because he was not subject to the Act on that date, he did not thereafter become subject to it and so remains the holder of an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s169"">",Sentence
 (b) The applicant's absorbed person visa did not cease to be in effect when the applicant left Australia involuntarily on 17 February 2001,Sentence
"53 Mr Hurley of Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that, by s 34(1) , the absorbed person visa is a class of permanent visa which permits a non-citizen to remain in, but not re-enter, Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s170"">(Section 82(8) provides that a visa to remain in but not to re-enter Australia ceases to be in effect if the holder leaves Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s171"">) However, Mr Hurley went on to submit that the decision in Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 84 ; (2005) 146 FCR 427 is incorrect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s172"">In that case, a Full Court of this Court held that where a decision to cancel a visa is quashed (as the applicant contended should happen in this case), the decision has at all times been a nullity with the consequence that the applicant would have been taken to have held a visa when he left Australia on 17 February 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s173"">54 In the applicant's submission, the Court should construe the words ""holder leaves Australia"" in s 82(8) as referring only to a voluntary departure.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s174"">His removal was an involuntary departure and subsequent conduct which gave effect to an invalid decision should not preclude the applicant from obtaining a constitutional writ in relation to the decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s175"">55 The applicant's second submission was that the provision in s 82(8) that a visa ""ceases to be in effect"", applies only where the visa is in existence at the moment when the ""holder"" leaves Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s176"">An alternative related submission was that, instead of finding jurisdictional error in the Minister's decision to cancel the applicant's visa, the Court should hold that the visa did not come to an end on the departure of the applicant on 17 February 2001 as, at that moment, he was not the ""holder"" of a visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s177"">In support of this proposition, attention was drawn to the distinction between a ""holder"" and a ""former holder"" of a visa; see s 15 of the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s178"">The applicant therefore contended that he had not been the ""holder"" of a visa on 17 February 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s179"">Jurisdictional error (Minister's failure to identify the applicant's visa)",Sentence
" 56 By notice of motion dated 14 July 2005 the applicant sought leave to make further submissions in support of his claim, amongst others, to hold an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s180"">57 The applicant submitted that a Full Court of this Court had recently held in Nystrom v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 121 , that the Minister had erred in purporting to cancel the applicant's Transitional (Permanent) Visa, by failing to consider whether the applicant could have been the holder of an absorbed person visa within s 34 of the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s181"">The Full Court had also rejected the Minister's submission that a decision to cancel one class of visa can be translated into a decision to cancel another class of visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s182"">According to the applicant, Nystrom is authority for the proposition that failure to identify the visa to be cancelled under s 501(2) of the Act constitutes jurisdictional error.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s183"">58 The applicant relied on Nystrom as demonstrating that he could not have been granted a Transitional (Permanent) Visa because, on 1 September 1994, he was not the ""holder"" of any entry permit as the last entry permit he had held would have been granted to him when he arrived in Australia in 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s184"">At that time, the Act did not require him to ""hold"" any visa at all.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s185"">This analysis was said to support his claim to hold an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s186"">59 Certain observations in Nystrom were also contended to support the applicant's claim that he was taken to have been granted a special category visa on 1 September 1994 by virtue of reg 17(1) and (2) of the Transitional Regulations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s187"">60 These submissions were relied on as supporting the applicant's alternative claim that the Minister had never received adequate advice as to which visa the applicant held and had therefore not had occasion to identify which visa it was that he had purported to cancel.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s188"">No such identification was to be found in the issues paper so the Minister had been given no guidance as to the type of visa he was purporting to cancel.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s189"">There had, therefore, been a jurisdictional error constituted by the Minister's failure to consider whether the applicant was the holder of an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s190"">Minister bound to consider consequences for the applicant of the Minister personally deciding to cancel",Sentence
 61 By the same motion on notice dated 14 July 2005 the applicant sought leave to make submissions based on the introduction of two new grounds of appeal.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s191"">62 First, the applicant submitted that the then Minister had erred because he had decided to cancel the applicant's visa without taking into account a relevant matter.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s192"">It was submitted that the Minister had personally made a decision under s 501 without considering that one of the consequences for the applicant would be the loss of a right to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s193"">The applicant submitted that no similar loss of the right occurs where the Minister orders deportation under s 200 of the Act for the commission of a crime described in s 201.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s194"">Such decisions are always subject to merits review unless the Minister makes a positive decision to issue a certificate under s 502(1)(a)(i).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s195"">63 The applicant submitted that the detailed preservation by Parliament of merits review of deportation for a crime unless the responsible Minister decides otherwise on the basis of national interest supports the view that the legislature did not intend that the review could be excluded by use of the general provisions in s 501.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s196"">This consideration was said to entail that the consequences for an applicant of a decision to cancel a visa are clearly relevant to be taken into account in making the decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s197"">Whether the Minister personally makes a decision or whether the decision is made by a delegate under s 501 is significant because of the profoundly different consequences for the applicant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s198"">In particular, whether an applicant is entitled to a review of that decision to cancel depends on whether the removal is enabled by s 201 , s 202 or s 501.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s199"">The applicant submitted that there is no evidence that the Minister considered this question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s200"">The failure of the Minister to consider the different consequences that would flow from his choice of the legislative avenue of cancellation was said to be a failure to take into account a relevant matter and therefore to constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s201"">Section 501 should be read down by reference to ss 200 and 201 of the Act",Sentence
" 64 Counsel for the applicant next contended that s 501 of the Act does not authorise the cancellation of a visa for failing the character test by reason of a ""substantial criminal record"" within s 501(6)(a) where the specific deportation powers in ss 200 and 201 do not apply to authorise the removal of the person from Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s202"">65 The applicant submitted that the material before the Minister invited him to find that the applicant did not pass the character test erected by s 501(6)(a) because he was caught by the ""substantial criminal record"" provisions in s 501(7).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s203"">It was further submitted that the issues paper invited the Minister to proceed on the basis of the applicant's conviction of 16 December 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s204"">In the applicant's submission, however, the relevant deportation power conferred by s 200 of the Act was not applicable to the applicant by reason of s 201.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s205"">Section 200 of the Act provides that the Minister may order the deportation of the non-citizen to whom the Division applies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s206"">Sub-paragraphs 201(b)(ii)(A) and (B) provide that s 200 only applies to a New Zealand citizen where ""when the offence was committed"" the person had been in Australia as an exempt non-citizen or special category visa holder for a period of less than ten years or as an exempt non-citizen or special category visa holder or combination of the two for periods that, when added together, amount to less than ten years in total.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s207"">66 The applicant's contention was that the material before the Minister established that the applicant was not a person to whom s 200 could apply.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s208"">The briefing paper demonstrated that the offence had been committed on 18 April 1999 and that the applicant had arrived in Australia as an exempt non-citizen on 24 May 1974 and had only departed on 4 March 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s209"">It was therefore submitted that he had been in Australia for a period that exceeded ten years when the offence to which the Minister's attention had been drawn was committed on 18 April 1999.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s210"">67 The specific power conferred by s 201 to deport non-citizens was said to be the sole source of a deportation power to be found in the Act .</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s211"">The power conferred by s 501 to cancel a visa cannot, Mr Hurley contended, be construed so as to permit the Minister to achieve indirectly that which Parliament has provided cannot be achieved directly, that is, removal of a New Zealand citizen who has committed a relevant offence more than ten years after his or her arrival in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s212"">This contention entailed that an Act must be construed so as to ascribe to each provision an exclusive, specific, task.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s213"">Such a construction of the Act would not permit s 501 to authorise the cancellation of the applicant's visa because, if it did, it would render ss 200 and 201 otiose.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s214"">As those sections remain in the Act , the applicant submitted, they should be given their full and exclusive force in relation to deportation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s215"">68 Counsel for the applicant also advanced the alternative, but related, submission that if ss 200 and 201 are capable of an operation which is inconsistent with the apparent intendment of s 501 they should prevail over the later, general provision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s216"">In support of this proposition, reference was made to Hoffman v Chief of Army [2004] FCAFC 148 ; (2004) 137 FCR 520 at [12] - [27] and Refrigerated Express Line A/Asia (Pty Ltd) v Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (1980) 29 ALR 333 at 347.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s217"">69 In support of the submission that the provisions in ss 200 and 201 are ""specific"" provisions and should prevail over a later general provision, the applicant relied on Smith v The Queen [1994] HCA 60 ; (1994) 181 CLR 338 and contended that here the later provision (s 501) was not itself so specific that it could retain a sphere of operation parallel to that of s 200 ; cf Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 66 FCR 511.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s218"">70 Accordingly, it was contended for the applicant that the decision of the Minister of 15 December 2000 was void for jurisdictional error because, on the proper construction of the Act , s 501 does not authorise a decision to cancel a visa in reliance on a criminal conviction if the holder of the visa cannot be deported pursuant to s 201 in reliance on the same conviction.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s219"">The Minister's submissions",Sentence
 Application for mandamus (Minister's failure to comply with s 501G),Sentence
"71 It was accepted that s 501G of the Act imposes upon the Minister a statutory obligation to provide reasons for a decision made under, amongst others, s 501 and that obligation had not been complied with in the present case.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s220"">However, the Minister's failure to provide reasons was said to be explicable by the fact that the decision had been made in December 2000 when it was believed that the delivery of the issues paper to the applicant would discharge the duty imposed upon him by s 501G ; see Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra) at [21].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s221"">It was not until the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v W157/00A [2002] FCAFC 281 ; (2002) 125 FCR 433 esp at 445-446 in September 2002 that the Minister could have known that the procedure which he had adopted did not fulfil his statutory obligations under s 501G(1)(e).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s222"">72 Dr Donaghue of Counsel for the Minister accepted that there is no evidence before the Court which demonstrates what visa the Minister thought he was cancelling when he made the impugned decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s223"">However, it was submitted, the Minister was clearly aware that the applicant was a citizen of New Zealand and a long term resident of Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s224"">There was no evidence before the Minister that the applicant had ever held an entry permit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s225"">Further, New Zealand citizens normally did not hold such permits.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s226"">It followed that it should also have been clear that the applicant may have been in the country unlawfully (given that there was no record of his arrival after March 1984) and that he had a history of offending that would have prevented him from having been absorbed into the community.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s227"">73 Although those considerations did not excuse the Minister's failure to comply with s 501G , Dr Donaghue urged that they explain it and negate any inference from the failure to provide reasons that there were not, in fact, any reasons for the decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s228"">Rather, it was submitted, it should be inferred that the Minister considered that the applicant held a special category visa, that being the visa most likely to be held by a New Zealand citizen to whom s 20 of the old Act applied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s229"">74 Dr Donaghue accepted that, ultimately, there is no way of knowing what visa the Minister thought the applicant held and which the Minister thus intended to cancel.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s230"">In the absence of a statement of reasons, it is similarly not possible to contend that the Minister did, or did not, take any relevant considerations into account in exercising his discretion under s 501.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s231"">There is, it was said, simply no basis for asserting that the Minister erred in making the decision of 15 December 2000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s232"">Counsel relied upon the High Court decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at [46] in support of the contention that a failure to give reasons cannot, of itself, amount to a jurisdictional error.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s233"">75 Counsel for the respondent referred to the express provision in s 502G(4) of the Act that ""A failure to comply with this section in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision"" and submitted that, notwithstanding the admitted failure to comply with s 501G , the Court should not order the respondent to provide reasons.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s234"">The application must fail because the applicant had not sought an order requiring the Minister to give reasons before the hearing of the application for judicial review.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s235"">That failure made applicable the observations of the Full Court in Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra), at [58]-[59].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s236"">76 In the second place, it was contended that, even if an order for the provision of reasons had been sought on an interlocutory basis, it should have been refused.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s237"">Mandamus is a discretionary remedy and ought not to be granted where the Minister who made the decision is no longer the relevant Minister (and therefore not a party to the proceeding) and in spite of the applicant's four year delay in bringing the proceedings as a consequence of his deliberate decision to circumvent Australian law and re-enter this country surreptitiously immediately after his removal rather than challenge the decision to cancel his visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s238"">The lapse of time makes it improbable that the Minister could now provide meaningful reasons; (see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Tavelli (1990) 23 FCR 162 at 178-179; Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1069 at [62] - [67] .</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s266"">(d) The applicant fell within s 20 of the Act",Sentence
"85 A further reason advanced on behalf of the Minister why the applicant could not have been granted an absorbed person visa was that s 34(2)(d) provides that a non-citizen is taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa only if, immediately before 1 September 1994, the non-citizen was not a person to whom s 20 of the Act as then in force applied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s267"">86 Section 20(1)(d)(ii), as then in force, provided, amongst other things, that a person might become an illegal citizen where he or she had been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of least one year.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s268"">On the Minister's argument, the applicant was a person to whom s 20(1)(d)(ii) applied as he had been convicted in 1964 of stealing from a person and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s269"">Section 20(1)(d)(ii) applied whether the person's entry into Australia occurred before or after its commencement and if ""on any occasion"" when the person had entered Australia the condition was satisfied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s270"">That occurred in the present case when the applicant entered Australia on 24 May 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s271"">He was therefore not a person who could have been taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa, irrespective of whether he otherwise satisfied the criteria in s 34(2).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s272"">87 Four reasons were advanced on behalf of the Minister for rejecting the applicant's contention that s 20 did not apply to New Zealand citizens.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s273"">In the first place, it requires s 20 to be read contrary to its express terms.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s274"">Sub-section 20(1) expressly identified the persons to whom it applied (see above at [ 31 ]) and did so in a way that was plainly capable of embracing New Zealand citizens because it created no distinction based on nationality.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s275"">88 Second, it was submitted, there was no policy reason why s 20 should not have applied to New Zealand citizens.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s276"">In particular, the Minister contended, there is no basis for excluding the application of s 20 merely because most New Zealand citizens in Australia did not hold entry permits.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s277"">The Minister disputed the existence of any necessary nexus between the operation of s 20 and the holding of an entry permit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s278"">Rather, it was argued, in order to understand the effect of falling within s 20 it is necessary to have regard to s 14(2) in the form in which it was before the amendments that commenced on 1 September 1994; see [ 32 ] above.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s279"">89 The effect of s 14(2), it was submitted, is that whether or not a person held an entry permit at the time when he or she fell within the operation of ss 14(2) and 20, that entry permit was cancelled by operation of s 35 of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s280"">Consequently, Counsel for the Minister submitted, despite the fact that at various times in the past New Zealand citizens have been allowed to enter Australia without entry permits, it does not follow that s 20 did not apply in relation to citizens of New Zealand.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s281"">The existence of an entry permit was not a necessary condition for the operation of s 14(2) or s 20.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s282"">On the contrary, the statutory regime created by ss 14 and 20 was concerned with the exclusion of undesirable persons from Australia whatever their nationality.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s283"">90 The Minister's third contention was that the applicant's submission that s 20 does not apply to New Zealand citizens is contrary to authority.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s284"">In this context, reference was made to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Sciascia (1991) 31 FCR 364 which concerned a New Zealand citizen who, in the circumstances, did not require an entry permit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s285"">91 The Minister's fourth submission under this head was that the applicant's contention that s 20 could not apply to New Zealand citizens was contrary the terms of regs 16 and 17 of the Transitional Regulations both of which were predicated upon the possibility that there were New Zealand citizens to whom s 20 applied.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s286"">92 In relation to the applicant's submission that s 20(1) ought not to have retrospective effect in the applicant's case as it produces absurd results, Counsel for the Minister submitted that the language of the section is clear.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s287"">It expressly applies to a non-citizen whether that non-citizen entered Australia ""before or after"" the commencement of the provision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s288"">In the Minister's submission, Parliament plainly intended the section to apply to non-citizens who were already in Australia when s 20 commenced (and who, therefore, had entered under a different legislative regime); see Sciascia per Sheppard J (dissenting) at 368.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s289"">Also in Sciascia the majority, Burchett and Lee JJ, gave s 20 a restricted interpretation on the basis that its retrospective effect may deprive of his or her right to community a person who had lived in Australia for 20 years as a lawful entrant.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s290"">For the Minister, it was submitted, however, that the paragraph of s 20 to which their Honours referred in that case is not presently relevant as the applicant has never become an Australian citizen and so s 20(1) continues to apply to him.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s291"">93 Dr Donaghue, on behalf of the Minister, submitted that the possibility that s 20 may operate to deny an absorbed person visa to a person who would otherwise have obtained such a visa because that person had ""ceased to be an immigrant"" was expressly recognised in s 34(2)(d).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s292"">94 In summary, the Minister contended that, as a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years, the applicant fell within the terms of s 20(1)(d)(ii).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s293"">He, therefore, did not satisfy the requirements of s 34(2)(d) of the Act on 1 September 1994.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s294"">Consequently, it was submitted, he had not been granted an absorbed person visa by operation of that section.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s295"">(e) The applicant held a special category visa",Sentence
"95 It was next submitted on behalf of the Minister that the applicant falls within the terms of reg 17 of the Transitional Regulations, which is reproduced at [ 33 ] above because he ""was, immediately before 1 September 1994, an illegal entrant because of s 20 of the old Act"" and he was not taken to hold any of the other visas listed in reg 17(1)(c).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s296"">He was therefore, the Minister contended, taken, by force of reg 17(2), to have been granted a special category visa on 1 September 1994.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s297"">96 Accepting that the term ""special category visa"" is not defined in the Transitional Regulations, Counsel for the Minister pointed to s 46(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which provides that expressions used in regulations have the same meaning as in the Act that conferred the power to make the regulations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s298"">""Special category visa"" in reg 17, was, therefore, said to have the same meaning as in s 32(1) of the Act (as in force from 1 September 1994) which makes it clear that a special category visa is a temporary visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s299"">97 Dr Donaghue further submitted that there is no inconsistency between reg 17 and s 32 of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s300"">Mr Hurley for the applicant had contended that the applicant could not have been granted a special category visa pursuant to reg 17 because he fell within the definition of ""behavioural concern non-citizen"" in s 32(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s301"">However, on the Minister's argument, no inconsistency arises because s 32(2)(a) is concerned with the criteria for the special category visa when it is granted as a result of an application for the visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s302"">Regulation 17, so the argument proceeded, deemed a class of persons to hold such a visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s303"">Parliament had not prescribed the criteria that must be satisfied by every member of a class of holders of a particular type of visa and, moreover, the terms of s 32(2)(b) and (c) support the granting of special category visas by reference to criteria other than those in s 32(2)(a).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s304"">98 In the same context, it was submitted on behalf of the Minister that reg 17 of the Transitional Regulations was a valid regulation made pursuant to s 40(6) of the Migration Reform Act 1992 which authorised a regulation stipulating that persons who fell within its scope were taken to have been granted ""special category visas"" in a specified ""amended Act class"" (defined in s 40(1) of the Migration Reform Act 1992 as a class of visas that is provided for by, or by regulations under, the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s305"">)",Sentence
"99 According to the Minister, the policy underlying reg 17, and specifically reg 17(1)(b)(ii), was that illegal entrants from New Zealand were to be granted special category visas if they had automatically become illegal entrants because of the operation of the old s 20 with the effect that those persons could then be considered for visa cancellation on a case by case basis.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s306"">Support for this contention was said to be derived from the Explanatory Statement of the Transitional Regulations.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s307"">100 Consequently, it was submitted, that, at the time when the Minister came to consider the cancellation of the applicant's visa on 15 December 2000, the only visa then held (and that could have been held) was a special category visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s308"">Jurisdictional error (Minister's failure to identify the applicant's visa)",Sentence
101 The applicant's reliance on the observations of the Full Court in Nystrom (supra) was said to be based on a misunderstanding because in Nystrom the Minister was found not to have considered the effect that the cancellation of a different visa held by the applicant would have upon his absorbed person visa as it was conceded that he did in fact hold one.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s309"">102 For the Minister it was submitted that the present applicant's contention that his circumstances are indistinguishable from those of the applicant in Nystrom is plainly incorrect.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s310"">First, it was not conceded that the applicant held an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s311"">Secondly, he had entered Australia as an adult, having grown up in New Zealand, and had an established criminal record at the time of entry in 1972.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s312"">On the Minister's view, he was therefore a prohibited immigrant pursuant to s 16 of the old Act and thus incapable of being absorbed into the community.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s313"">Further, on his own evidence, he had evaded immigration officials to enter Australia during March or April 1984 (the uncertainty as to the date making it possible that he was not even present in Australia on 2 April 1984 as required in order to satisfy s 34(2)(a) of the Act).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s314"">The applicant, it was said, did not satisfy any of the criteria for the grant of an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s315"">103 By contrast, according to the Minister, the applicant in Nystrom , had entered Australia as a four week old baby in the company of his mother, who had migrated to Australia some eight years earlier.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s316"">He had grown up in Australia and did not commence offending until after 2 April 1984 (the relevant date for absorption purposes under s 34 of the Act).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s317"">Moreover, the applicant in Nystrom had never evaded immigration officials or committed an offence that might have brought him within the terms of s 20 of the old Act and there was no doubt that he was actually in Australia on 2 April 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s318"">Consequently, the Minister had conceded in Nystrom that the applicant held an absorbed person visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s319"">There, the Minister further contended, the applicant had also held a Transitional (Permanent) visa which was the visa which the Minister had purported to cancel.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s320"">The Full Court held that the cancellation had miscarried because the Minister had not considered the effect that the cancellation would have upon the applicant's absorbed person visa by operation of s 501F(3) of the Act (which provides for the cancellation of all visas held by an applicant upon the cancellation of a particular visa).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s321"">104 It followed, according to the Minister, that the issue that had been determinative in Nystrom does not arise in the present case because the applicant does not hold an absorbed person visa; he only held one visa --- a special category visa granted by force of s 17 of the Transitional Regulations, so that the effect on a different visa of the cancellation of one visa does not arise.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s322"">105 The Minister accepted the applicant's submission that he did not ""hold"" a Transitional (Permanent) visa, but contended that Nystrom is irrelevant to that proposition because the reason why the applicant held no such visa is that he had been refused entry to Australia in 1984 and had thereafter entered illegally.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s323"">It was submitted that he obviously did not hold an entry permit irrespective of the complications discussed in Nystrom about when a person in the ""holder"" of an entry permit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s324"">106 In the present case, Dr Donaghue submitted, the Minister should be taken to have cancelled the applicant's special category visa which was the only visa that he was capable of holding.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s325"">It was accepted that the authorities establish that it is a jurisdictional error to cancel the wrong visa, but the applicant had not made those authorities applicable to himself by showing that the Minister had cancelled the wrong visa and had therefore not discharged the burden of establishing the ground of review upon which he relies.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s326"">The Minister was not required to consider the ""consequences"" for the applicant of the Minister's deciding personally to cancel the visa",Sentence
 107 On 28 July 2005 the respondent filed submissions in opposition to the applicant's notice of motion of 14 July 2005 by which the applicant had sought leave to file a further amended application in relation to existing grounds of review and introducing two new grounds of appeal summarised at [ 61 ]-[ 70 ] above.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s327"">108 In response, Dr Donaghue submitted that the applicant's contention that it is a jurisdictional error for the Minister to make a decision personally under s 501 without adverting to the consequences of such a decision for the visa holder, was precisely the argument rejected by French J in Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 757 , at [52].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s328"">His Honour there found unsustainable the proposition that the availability of merits review is a relevant consideration which the Minister is required to take into account in the exercise of the power to cancel a visa and the same proposition was rejected in Griffiths v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FMCA 249 ; (2003) FLR 272, at [91]-[95].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s329"">109 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the applicant's contention is inconsistent with the generality of authority in this Court in relation to the operation of s 501 including Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Huynh [2004] FCAFC 256 ; (2004) 139 FCR 505 where Kiefel and Bennett JJ, at [72], approved an earlier reference to the discretion to cancel a visa under s 501 as unfettered.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s330"">It was further held by their Honours that there is no implied obligation on the Minister to consider specific factors personal to the visa-holder when making a cancellation decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s331"">This entails, Dr Donaghue submitted, that the Minister cannot be required to consider the consequences of a particular cancellation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s332"">110 Whilst acknowledging that the majority in Nystrom had suggested, at [26] that ""it is timely for there to be a review by the Minister of the proper approach to matters such as"" occurred in that case, Counsel for the Minister pointed out that the majority in Nystrom indicated that actual ministerial consideration is only required for cases of particular political sensitivity which does not include instances of ordinary criminal conduct like that which had occurred in Nystrom.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s333"">",Sentence
"111 According to the Minister, the decision of French J in Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 757 referred to at [ 108 ] above should be followed unless the Court were satisfied that it was plainly wrong which, in the Minister's submission, the Court could not be.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s334"">Accordingly, leave to raise the new ground should be refused, or the ground should be rejected.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s335"">Section 501 should not be read down by reference to ss 200 and 201 of the Act",Sentence
112 Counsel for the Minister acknowledged that the applicant's second proposed additional ground of appeal derives support from the reasoning of the majority in Nystrom which held that s 501 should not be used to circumvent the limitations in s 201 and that to do so would disadvantage retrospectively permanent visa holders who happen to be non-citizens.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s336"">Nevertheless, it was submitted on behalf of the Minister that no argument had been directed in Nystrom to the relationship between ss 200, 201 and 501 of the Act as the applicant had not contended that s 501 was incapable of supporting the decision to cancel his visa.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s337"">In consequence, the majority appears to have overlooked a considerable body of authority which is inconsistent with the suggestion that ""it may be that the specific power conferred by s 201 to deport non-citizens who have committed crimes is the only source of power to deport""; (see Nystrom at [27]).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s338"">113 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Gunner (1998) 84 FCR 400, an appeal against a judgment of Sackville J who had held that the Minister could not exercise powers under ss 501 and 502 to cancel a visa in circumstances in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had previously set aside a decision to deport a person pursuant to s 200, the Full Court held, at 408-409, that the Minister had been entitled to rely upon s 501.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s339"">It was further held that in doing so ""he exercised a separate power (from that conferred by ss 200 and 201) which was available to him and the exercise of which was directed towards the purpose for which the power was conferred, namely, the removal from Australia of non-citizens who have committed serious crimes or are otherwise not of good character"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s340"">The Minister further submitted that the reasoning of the Full Court in Gunner had been specifically approved by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s341"">114 In Bridges v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1647 ; (2001) 114 FCR 456, another Full Court of this Court rejected the submission that a non-citizen permanently resident in Australia for more than ten years should be assured that no criminal offences can affect his or her status as a member of the Australian community, holding that a decision-maker could, in the exercise of the discretion to deport under s 200, consider offences committed at any time.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s342"">Dr Donaghue also referred to Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 959 in support of his submission that the use of a specific power given to the Minister under the Act is unfettered and also relied, in support of that submission, on the observations of Kiefel J (speaking for the Full Court) in Lu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2000) 176 ALR 79, at [5].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s343"">115 The Minister's response to the applicant's submission that s 501 is a ""general provision"" which yields to the ""specific provisions"" in s 200 was that it is directly inconsistent with the judgments of the Full Courts of this Court noted in the two preceding paragraphs which make it plain that ss 200 and 201 can operate in parallel with s 501; the existence of one power does not exclude or limit the others.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s344"">116 Moreover, in the Minister's submission, s 501(2) is not properly to be characterised as a ""general power"" but is, rather, a specific power to cancel the visas of persons who, the Minister reasonably suspects, do not pass the character test.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s345"">The fact that circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a person does not pass the character test might also expose that person to deportation does not mean that s 501(2) is being used to ""circumvent"" s 201.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s346"">The two provisions are different and different legal consequences follow the exercise of each power even though the practical effect for a visa hold may be substantially the same; see per Kiefel J in Lu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra) at [15].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s347"">Accordingly, Counsel for the Minister contended that, although Nystrom afforded some support for the applicant's argument, ss 200 and 201 do not limit the power conferred by s501(2) of the Act which is a ""distinct source of Ministerial power"", the proper construction of which is not affected by s 201.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s348"">117 Alternatively, it was submitted that, for the applicant to succeed on this ground, he had to show that he would not have been susceptible to deportation under s 200 of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s349"">In the Minister's submission, the applicant had failed to satisfy that requirement because he had concentrated on his ""most recent criminal record"", and the fact that the issues paper given to the Minister in relation to s 501 had focused on the 1999 drug offences.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s350"">That reliance on the contents of the issues paper was said to be misconceived because the Minister had not been purporting to exercise any power under s 200; whether the applicant was susceptible to deportation depended upon all of the relevant facts not just those highlighted in the issues paper.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s351"">One such relevant fact was said to be the conviction recorded against the applicant in Australia in May 1964 for stealing from a person for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s352"">As a consequence, he attracted the application of s 201(b)(ii) because s 201(a) makes it clear that the section applies to convictions whether ""before or after the commencement of this section"".</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s353"">Consequently, at the time of his conviction, the applicant was a New Zealand exempt non-citizen who had been in Australia for less than ten years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s354"">118 Counsel for the Minister defended this point as neither academic nor unfair.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s355"">It was the applicant's conviction in 1964 which had resulted in his being refused permission to enter Australia in 1984.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s356"">That conviction brought him within s 16 of the Act as it then stood and took him outside the scope of the exemption that ordinarily permitted New Zealand citizens to enter this country.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s357"">Accordingly, the applicant, having been present in Australia for the last 20 years by reason of his circumvention of immigration controls in 1984, could not reasonably deny that it was open to the Minister to base his deportation on the 1964 conviction.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s358"">It was said to follow that, even without the assistance of the Full Court authorities, the Minister had shown that s 200 had not been circumvented because the restrictions erected by that section would not have prevented the applicant from being deported.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s359"">Extension of time",Sentence
"119 Further or alternatively, Counsel for the Minister submitted that, even if the Court were to conclude that the Minister may have erred in making the decision, the relief should be refused for discretionary reasons; (see R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 407 for a discussion of factors relevant to the discretion to decline relief).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s360"">120 Although the Rules of this Court do not specify a time limit for the bringing of applications under s 39B of the Judiciary Act , the factors relevant to the discretionary refusal of prohibition in this Court were said to be those relevant to the determination of whether extensions of time should be granted under the High Court Rules; (see S58 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 451 per Madgwick J, at [21]).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s361"">121 The four year delay in instituting proceedings for judicial review was said to be extremely lengthy and there was no suggestion that the Minister had contributed to it; see Re Commonwealth; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491, at 495 where an application for an extension of time under the High Court rules was refused because of a 17 month delay).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s362"">Such a delay may lead to the refusal of relief even where the decision challenged has involved jurisdictional error; Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2001) 204 CLR 82, 106-107 [53], 108 [56]-[57]; NAUV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 124 ; (2004) 82 ALD 784, at [38] and [44].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s363"">In this case the delay had been caused by the applicant's decision to circumvent the decision by unlawful means (the applicant accepted removal from Australia and then immediately returned to resume his former life instead of challenging the validity of the decision within a reasonable period of the decision having been made).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s364"">In the Minister's submission, the applicant has only mounted a curial challenge to the decision because his unlawful attempts to circumvent it have failed and the Court should not lend its aid to those who invoke the law only after resorting to unlawful means in an attempt to achieve their objectives.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s365"">122 A related consideration was said to be that, because of the applicant's failure to challenge the decision in a timely fashion, the Minister was unaware of any issue of invalidity of the decision until four years after it had been made.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s366"">That delay has been prejudicial because it is now too late for the relevant Minister to prepare a meaningful or admissible statement of reasons.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s367"">123 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the applicant's further involvement in unlawful activities relating to drugs and the fact that the Minister's decision had been founded in part on the applicant's unlawful re-entry into Australia and his resumption of criminal activities cast doubt upon the genuineness of the applicant's opposition to the decision to cancel his visa on character grounds including his claims that his involvement in drugs had been attributable to naivet&eacute; and that he would not engage in future criminal activity in Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s368"">124 Finally, Dr Donaghue submitted that the Court should refuse relief because it would be futile in any event.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s369"">It was submitted that, even if the applicant had, in fact, held a visa before 15 December 2000 and the Minister's decision was for some reason invalid and liable to be set aside, any visa that the applicant had held would have lapsed when he left Australia in February 2001.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s370"">That would have occurred as a result of s 82(8) of the Act or, if the applicant had held an absorbed person visa, by force of s 34(1).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s371"">Consequently, even if the decision be set aside, it would follow that the applicant does not presently hold a visa and therefore would remain an unlawful non-citizen; (see Hicks v Nixon [2004] FCA 290 ; (2004) 138 FCR 32 at [44] and [49]).</sentence>",Sentence

"<sentence id=""s373"">It was conceded on behalf of the Minister that his reasons do not conform with s 501G(1)(e).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s374"">However, it is clear that when the Minister signed the issues paper he thought that, in doing so, he was complying with his statutory obligations under s 501G and that the issues paper, as signed, disclosed his reasons as required by s 501G(1)(e).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s375"">This was the conclusion reached in similar circumstances by a Full Court of this Court in Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra) following a body of authority comprised by judgments of single Judges of this Court to that effect: Diep v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1130 ; Javillonar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 854 ; (2001) 114 FCR 311; Adams v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 552 and Ruhl v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 184 ALR 401 at [29].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s376"">126 It was also concluded in Howells that it was not until a decision of a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v W157/00A [2002] FCAFC 281 ; (2002) 125 FCR 433 in September 2002 that the Minister could have known that the procedure which he had adopted did not comply with his statutory obligations under s 501G(1)(e).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s377"">In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme (supra), at [40] and [54], the High Court of Australia held that the signing of an issues paper of the kind used in the present case did not comply with s 501G(1)(e).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s378"">127 Howells is also authority for the proposition that the Minister's state of mind does not excuse the failure to give reasons but only explains that failure and that it remains that the Minister has not given the applicant written notice that sets out the reasons for the decision; see [24]-[25].</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s379"">Counsel for the Minister in the present case opposed any order requiring reasons to be given.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s380"">There are sound arguments for and against the making of such an order.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s381"">On the one hand, to require the Minister to give reasons is in the public interest in ensuring that Ministers of the Crown perform their statutory duties.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s382"">However, the applicant's delay in seeking reasons for the Minister's decision and his failure to seek, before the hearing of his substantive application, mandamus compelling the provision of reasons weigh against an exercise of discretion by making such an order now.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s383"">128 The applicant sought to explain his delay by asserting that he had never received a copy of the issues paper.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s384"">Whether or not he ever received the issues paper, the circumstance that the applicant has resided in Australia since his deportation on 17 February 2001 suggests to me that his delay has been in consequence of a deliberate decision to circumvent Australian law and re-enter the country surreptitiously immediately after his removal rather than challenge the cancellation decision.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s385"">A further consequence of the delay is that the Minister who made the decision, on 15 December 2000, the Honourable Philip Ruddock, is no longer the Minister and has not been the Minister since October 2003.</sentence>",Sentence

There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area. Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water. Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 ; (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11] ---[12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons. As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant's packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced ( Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed).

Although there was no dispute as to the applicable law, and very little real dispute as to primary fact, the trial extended over 12 days, with experienced senior and junior counsel on both sides, and a 10,557 page court book. If Cadbury had its way, the trial would have included issues of quantum and also much expert evidence, and probably taken another week at least. The threat of ruinous costs in such litigation, even if it is ""only"" irrecoverable costs for a party who succeeds, has important practical consequences for competition: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 at [30] - [31].  9 Disputes as to names and get-ups between rival traders constitute a familiar genre of commercial litigation. The applicable law is well settled. Questions as to the nature of the reputation enjoyed by a plaintiff and the effect of a defendant's conduct on consumers are likely to be problematic. In the present case Cadbury was obviously encouraged by the experts it had recruited. In the present case I held that most of this evidence was inadmissible: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363.

"<sentence id=""s94"">He agreed that in an application for membership of a superannuation fund he had referred to her as his partner.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s95"">He said he had no idea why he put partner instead of friend.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s96"">Similarly, in a 'New Employees Detail Form' under the heading 'Emergency Contact' he had listed her and described her relationship to him as 'partner'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s97"">At the top of the same form he described his marital status as 'single'.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s98"">He told the Tribunal that, as it was a job application form, it was important to indicate he had a partner, even though he had actually described his marital status as single.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s99"">He accepted on further questioning that the form in question was not a job application form.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s100"">17 Mr Colin Whittaker, for whom Ms Pelka cares, said he had known her for eight to nine years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s101"">She had been his carer since 2000.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s102"">She had been away with him on a number of business trips including a three month period when they were travelling around Australia.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s103"">He had never been aware of any boyfriend.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s104"">18 After setting out the contending submissions from Ms Pelka and the Secretary, the Tribunal gave consideration to various aspects of the relationship as it emerged from the evidence in determining whether or not Ms Pelka was in a marriage-like relationship with Mr Kuhl for the period during which she was receiving carer payments.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s105"">19 The Tribunal found that Ms Pelka and Mr Kuhl did not jointly own any real estate, nor have any joint bank accounts or joint liabilities.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s106"">After the purchase of the apartment Ms Pelka's income and property settlement serviced and paid off the mortgage.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s107"">Mr Kuhl paid gas, electricity and the telephone accounts.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s108"">Ms Pelka paid the rates.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s109"">Mr Kuhl had recently begun to pay a modest rent of $55 a week.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s110"">Through the entire 16 years of their cohabitation Ms Pelka and Mr Kuhl had maintained a 'barter system' under which she did not receive any rent but instead an annual overseas holiday.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s111"">The Tribunal said: 'This reflects a significant level of trust and financial cooperation on both sides.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s112"">'The Tribunal found that Ms Pelka and Mr Kuhl provided for themselves in all day to day requirements but that their financial relationship involved significant cooperation, pooling of resources and mutual benefit.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s113"">20 Turning to their household the Tribunal found that Ms Pelka and Mr Kuhl each had a bedroom but shared a common kitchen, lounge room and bathroom.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s114"">The bedroom furniture was their own and Mr Kuhl had supplied most of the lounge room furniture.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s115"">Ms Pelka did more housework.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s116"">She could not recall if they ate together once a week, fortnight or a month, but they did eat together at times when she cooked extra food.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s117"">21 On the social aspects of their relationship, the Tribunal observed that Ms Pelka's description of her relationship with Mr Kuhl was at times contradictory.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s118"">She had said to the SSAT that they had a very close spiritual bond.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s119"">They had become close after she met Mr Kuhl's parents.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s120"">She described their relationship as like a sister and brother --- a close bond in a spiritual way.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s121"">At other times she said it was just a matter of convenience that he lived in the apartment.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s122"">She had no right to know where he was.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s123"">22 At [42] the Tribunal said:",Sentence
 'The difficulty the Tribunal had in gaining a clear understanding of the god-brother/god-sister relationship was exacerbated by the evidence highlighting the marked contrast in the relationship between the applicant and Mr Kuhl at home and overseas.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s124"">At home their evidence painted a picture of separate lives bordering on complete disregard for the whereabouts or activities of the other apart from the occasional movie, meal or plans for the next overseas trip.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s125"">Then for up to 4 weeks a year for at least 12 years they travelled overseas together, ate together regularly and slept in the same room.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s126"">In addition, the applicant said she would allow Mr Kuhl to live cost free, for example, if unemployed.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s127"">The Tribunal concluded that this was the most significant relationship the applicant appeared to have in her life involving a close bond, trust and very considerable emotional significance.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s128"">'23 On the question of sexual relationship, the Tribunal referred to Ms Pelka and Mr Kuhl's evidence that they had no sexual relationship.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s129"">It did not make any express finding in that respect but appears to have accepted the evidence.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s130"">As to the nature of their commitment to each other, it said (at [44]):",Sentence
" 'The applicant, who describes her relationship as a close spiritual bond has allowed Mr Kuhl to live in her unit for some 16 years.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s131"">Even since she recently left the unit she has allowed him to continue to reside there.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s132"">Mr Kuhl whilst on the one hand giving evidence that there was no emotion involved in their relationship had made her a beneficiary of his superannuation and will.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s133"">The Tribunal concludes that their commitment to each other has been long standing and close and there is no evidence of any other significant relationships during the period in question.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s134"">'24 The Tribunal found that: '... the weight of evidence supports the finding that at the relevant time Ms Pelka was in a marriage-like relationship and was a member of a couple for the purposes of s 4(2) of the Act, satisfying s 4(2)(b) of the Act.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s135"">'25 The Tribunal then turned to the basis upon which the carer's payment was calculated, noting that the partner's income must be taken into account.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s136"">It found that, because Ms Pelka's partner's income was not taken into account an overpayment had resulted and, pursuant to s 1223(1) of the Act, was a debt to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s137"">26 The Tribunal referred to provisions of the Act allowing for the waiver of a debt particularly where the overpayment is attributable solely to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth (s 1237A(1)).</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s138"">It held that the debt had not arisen due to such an error.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s139"">Ms Pelka had answered 'no' to the question 'Do you (and your partner) share with anyone else?</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s140"">' on the claim for carer payment which she filled out.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s141"">The Tribunal was not convinced of the accuracy of her recollection that she had rung Centrelink and had been told that if someone were a brother or god-brother they did not have to be listed as sharing accommodation.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s142"">27 The Tribunal also referred to s 1237AAD of the Act providing for waiver in the case of special circumstances.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s143"">There was no evidence before the Tribunal that there were special circumstances and it held that it was unnecessary to consider that provision further.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s144"">The grounds of appeal28 The grounds of appeal, which were amended by consent at the hearing, alleged a number of errors of law on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s145"">Those maintained at the hearing may be summarised as follows: 1.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s146"">Finding that the applicant was in a marriage-like relationship within the meaning of s 4(3) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) when such a finding was not supported by the evidence and was contrary to the weight of the evidence.</sentence>",Sentence

" THE FUND RULES 4 On 31 October 1994, the employer and the trustee executed a deed to which were annexed rules.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s19"">The fund had been in existence for some time, but the previous rules were wholly replaced by the rules annexed to the deed of 31 October 1994.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s20"">Those rules were divided into a series of articles.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s21"">Article 1 contained definitions; art 2 dealt with the subject of eligibility for, and membership of, the fund; art 3 dealt with contributions, both by members and by the employer; art 4 dealt with the subject of 'benefit, entitlement and determination'; art 5 was concerned with the payment of benefits; art 6 dealt with the administration of the fund; art 7 was concerned with the assets, expenses and investments of the fund; art 8 covered records, accounts and evaluations; art 9 contained provisions governing the appointment, removal and functions of the trustee; art 10 provided for the admission to the fund of an 'associated employer', and provisions relevant to that matter; art 11 was concerned with the winding up of the fund; and art 12 dealt with the replacement of the employer, should it be unable or unwilling to continue as a contributor.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s22"">There were thirteen schedules to the rules, and I shall refer to them only as necessary in my reasons which follow.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s23"">5 Article 4 of the rules was divided into seven separate rules, the heading to each of which was, for the most part, explanatory of the subject matter dealt with therein.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s24"">Those headings were: normal retirement benefit; late retirement benefit; permanent disablement benefit; death in service benefit; death in retirement benefit; other termination of service and other benefits.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s25"">Rule 4.3, 'permanent disablement benefit', provided as follows: ""A Member who retires from Service on the grounds of Permanent Disablement shall be entitled to receive a Permanent Disablement Benefit determined in accordance with Schedule 10 hereto.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s26"">",Sentence
 Where a Member is not acceptable at standard rates under any insurance policy which the Trustees may effect for the purposes of reinsuring a portion of a Permanent Disablement Benefit the amount of any Benefit otherwise payable under this Rule may be reduced by such amount as the Trustees may consider appropriate.</sentence>,Sentence
"<sentence id=""s27"">The Member shall be advised of any such reduction.</sentence>",Sentence
"<sentence id=""s28"">""",Sentence
,
 6 Schedule 10 provided that the 'permanent disablement benefit' would be 'the member's accrued benefit as at the date of permanent disablement'.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s29"">The term 'member's accrued benefit' was not defined in the rules, but item (b) of Sch 7 provided that the 'accrued benefit' would be 'the sum of the accrued member benefit and the accrued employer benefit'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s30"">The accrued member benefit had two parts.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s31"">The first part was the 'accumulated member contributions' at the beginning of the financial year, increased by contributions made by the member during the year and by the proceeds of any individual insurance policies on which premiums, funded out of member contributions, had been paid, and decreased by the amount of those premiums and by benefits paid in respect of the member during the year.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s32"">The second part required that there be added to the first part an amount representing a share of the profit for the financial year, determined in accordance with provisions there set out.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s33"">The accrued employer benefit likewise had two parts.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s34"">The first part was the 'accumulated employer contributions' at the beginning of the financial year, increased by contributions made by the employer during the year and by the proceeds of any individual insurance policies in respect of the member on which premiums, funded out of employer contributions, had been paid, and decreased by the amount of those premiums and by benefits paid in respect of the member during the year, to the extent that they could not be dealt with under the corresponding provisions of 'accumulated member contributions'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s35"">The second part required that there be added to the first part an amount representing a share of the profit for the financial year, determined in accordance with provisions there set out.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s36"">What was significant (in the context of the present case) about these provisions of Sch 7 and Sch 10 was the circumstance that a part of the permanent disablement benefit was the proceeds of insurance policies received in respect of the member in question.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s37"">7 Although, as I have noted above, the rules provided for the payment of a benefit in the event of 'permanent disablement', that term was not defined.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s38"">Instead, the rules contained a definition of 'total and permanent disablement', as follows: ""Total and Permanent Disablement: In relation to a Member means a Member who, is the absolute and final opinion of the Trustee is by reason of permanent incapacity or permanent invalidity unlikely to engage in any occupation for which the Member is reasonably qualified by eduction, training and experience and which provides an equivalent level of remuneration to that Member as if the Member were gainfully employed PROVIDED THAT if the Trustee has effected a Policy in relation to the Member the Trustee may determine that the meaning of Total and Permanent Disablement shall, subject to a Relevant Requirement, in respect of a Member be modified so as to be identical to the circumstances in which an amount is payable by the insurer under such Policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s39"">The term ""Totally and permanently Disabled"" has a corresponding meaning for the purpose of this Deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s40"">""",
"It was uncontroversial, both before the tribunal and before the court, that the entitling event under cl 4.3 --- 'permanent disablement' --- was the same as the event defined in the rules as 'total and permanent disablement'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s41"">",
" 8 The other provision of the rules which should be noted was r 4.7, which provided as follows: ""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained the Trustee in its absolute discretion may pay to a Member at any time any amount provided that such payment will not prejudice Government Approval of the Fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s42"">"" 9 The rules annexed to the deed were further amended, in respects not presently relevant, on 1 July 1996.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s43"">The rules as so amended remained in those terms, including the terms to which I have referred above, when the complainant joined the fund in 1997 and when he ceased working on 19 May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s44"">10 In August 1997 --- ie just after the complainant joined the fund --- the trustee published a 'member booklet'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s45"">Although it was implicit in the trustee's submissions that this booklet received at least some distribution amongst fund members, that was not a relevant fact, and the tribunal made no finding about it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s46"">The terms of certain explanations contained in the booklet were, however, relevant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s47"">Under the heading 'Introduction', the following appeared in the booklet: ""The Auspine Staff Superannuation Fund provides you and your family with valuable benefits on your: &#8226; retirement; &#8226; death; &#8226; total and permanent disablement; or &#8226; leaving employment.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s48"">",
" This is an employer sponsored Fund, the sponsoring employer being Auspine Limited.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s49"">",
 The Fund was established in 1985 and provides accumulation benefits for all members.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s50"">",
 Contributions are paid to the Fund and accumulate with interest.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s51"">The accumulated balance of these contributions is your entitlement on leaving service for any reason.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s52"">",
 There are also insured benefits which are payable in the event of your death or disablement provided the necessary insurance cover is in place and the insurance claim is accepted.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s53"">",
" This approach is very much like a savings account, topped up with some insurance cover.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s54"">Concessional tax rates apply to savings accumulated in approved superannuation arrangements, but access to your savings is restricted by rules designed to ""preserve"" your savings until retirement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s55"">",
 This booklet outlines the main features of the Fund.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s56"">""",
"Under the heading 'Contributions' it was stated that the employer made contributions in accordance with the requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation, and that members were permitted, though not required, to make their own contributions.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s57"">Under the heading 'Vesting', the following appeared:",
" ""All contributions made to this Fund are ""fully vested"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s58"">This means that on leaving service for any reason, at any age, you receive the total of all contributions made, with interest, less tax, insurance premiums and an allowance for administrative expenses.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s59"">""",
"Under the heading 'Benefits', the benefits available under various circumstances were described, and the following appeared under the sub-heading 'Benefit of Total and Permanent Disablement':",
" ""The Trustee also arranges insurance cover which can be claimed should you become totally and permanently disabled and be unable to continue working at your usual occupation or any other occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s60"">",
" Total and permanent disablement (""TPD"") can be assessed after you have been absent from work for a continuous period of six months.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s61"">It is important that you make sure that you advise the Trustee before you leave the Fund and before the 6 months has expired if you think you may need to claim this benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s62"">",
 Your benefit in the event of total and permanent disablement will be equal to: - the total amount of all account balances held in your name in the Fund; and - any insured benefit payable.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s63"">",
 The Fund's insurer will request medical evidence relating you your disablement and their opinion will be taken into account when the Trustee decides if you can be paid this benefit.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s64"">",
 Please provide immediate written notification to the Personnel Officer if any event occurs which could lead to a disablement claim being lodged.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s65"">Failure to provide notification can result in a claim being rejected.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s66"">""",
"On 26 November 1999 --- ie 6 months and 7 days after the complainant ceased work, but while he remained employed by the employer --- the trust deed was very substantially amended.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s67"">The amending deed contained a number of recitals, including Recital F, which read: 'the effective date of this amending deed is 1 July 1996'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s68"">Under cl 11.4 of the deed as amended, the trustee had the following powers (amongst others):",
" ""(a) to settle, compromise or submit to arbitration any claims matters or things relating to the Deed, the Rules, the Fund or to the respective rights and obligations of the Principal Employer, an Employer, the Members, their Personal Representatives or other beneficiaries; (b) to commence, carry on, defend, compound, settle, abandon or otherwise deal with proceedings (including legal proceedings) relating to the Deed, the Rules, the Fund or the respective rights and obligations of the Principal Employer, an Employer, the Members, their Personal Representatives or other beneficiaries;""",
,
" 11 The 'permanent disablement benefit' was the amount which would have been payable on death, which amount in turn involved two elements: first, the 'member's fund credit', and secondly, an 'insured amount' which depended upon which of certain options the member had selected in relation to life insurance.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s69"">I need not go further into the detail of that, as r 7.3 of the amended rules provided that the benefit payable upon TPD would not be greater than the sum of - ""(a) the Member's Fund Credit at the date used for calculation of a benefit; and (b) The amount received from the Insurance Company (if any) as elected by the Member and payable under the Master Policy to the Trustee to provide a benefit in respect of the particular Member under this Rule.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s70"">""",
The definition of TPD in the amended deed was the same as that in the original rules.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s71"">It is also important to note that the amended deed no longer contained a provision in the terms of cl 4.7 of the deed as last amended in 1996, to which I have referred in par 8 above.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s72"">THE INSURANCE POLICY 12 On 1 January 1997, the trustee entered into an insurance policy, called a 'group superannuation policy', with the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s73"">Under that policy, the insurer said that it would, subject to the conditions set out therein, ""pay to the Trustees on the death or Total and Permanent Disablement of an Insured Person the Group Life Insurance in respect of such Insured Person ascertained in accordance with Condition 4 hereof ....""",
"Condition 4 provided, amongst other things, that, subject to the policy, 'in the event of ... Total and Permanent Disablement .... of an Insured Person the amount of Group Life Insurance in respect of him as at ... the Date of Disablement ...' would be paid to the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s74"">The claimant was an insured person within the meaning of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s75"">The expression 'Date of Disablement' was defined to mean the later of the date on which the illness, accident or injury commenced or occurred which led to TPD, or the date on which the insured person was last at work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s76"">In the circumstances of the complainant, to the extent that this definition was relevant, it was the second meaning which operated.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s77"">",
" 13 The policy defined 'Total and Permanent Disablement' of an insured person as a disablement which: ""(1) occurs prior to his sixty-fifth birthday, and (2) occurs while he is insured for Total and Permanent Disablement under this policy, and (3) Occurs while he is in the active service of the Employer, and either: (a) results from an illness, accident or injury and results in him being continuously absent from his employment for at least six consecutive months commencing prior to his sixty-fifth birthday and AMP has determined that it is unlikely he will ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he is reasonably fitted by education, training or experience ... or (b) [not relevant]",
This definition was quite different from the corresponding definition appearing in the rules of the trust deed under the fund.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s78"">A difference which was of great importance in the present case was the additional qualifier in the definition in the rules after the word 'experience', namely the words 'and which provides an equivalent level of remuneration to that Member as if the Member were gainfully employed'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s79"">",
" 14 Before leaving the policy, I should refer also to an earlier policy which the trustee had taken out with the insurer, in July 1993.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s80"">For some reason which does not appear, that earlier policy was also in the materials before the tribunal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s81"">No party suggested that it was relevant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s82"">However, it contained a definition of the expression 'Date of Disablement' which included the following paragraph: ""(c) in the case of ""Total and Permanent Disablement"" as a result of the cause in sub-paragraph (a) of its definition (not immediately preceded by a period during which benefits were paid in respect of Temporary Total Disablement), or in the case of Accidental Disablement, the date six months after the later of: (i) the date on which the illness, accident or injury commenced or occurred, and (ii) the date on which the Insured Person was last at work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s83"">""",
,
"The difference between this definition and the definition in the policy which applied in the facts of the case is that this definition interposes a period of six months between the date on which the illness etc occurred, or the person was last at work, and the date which is defined as the date of disablement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s84"">THE COMPLAINANT'S CIRCUMSTANCES 15 Returning to the complainant's own circumstances, as I have said, he consulted his general practitioner, Dr Nelson, in March and again in May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s85"">In a letter over the hand of another practitioner at the same practice (Dr Ridgway) which was in evidence, it is stated that Workcover certificates were provided following the complainant's absence from work after 19 May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s86"">In the same letter, it is stated that the complainant presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer in July 1999 (which required him to remain absent from work during that month).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s87"">16 The complainant was examined by two psychiatrists engaged by the relevant workers compensation insurer in late 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s88"">Dr Garland reported to the insurer on 17 November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s89"">In its decision of 13 May 2005, the tribunal noted that Dr Garland considered that the complainant was capable of working full time at his usual job, and that no treatment was indicated.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s90"">The other psychiatrist who saw the complainant at about this time was Dr Mendelson, who reported to the workers compensation insurer on 18 November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s91"">The tribunal noted that Dr Mendelson diagnosed a mild anxiety state, and was of the opinion that the complainant could work full time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s92"">17 By a report dated 20 September 2000, Dr O'Kelly, a clinical psychologist, said that the complainant first consulted her on 26 March 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s93"">The tribunal noted that Dr O'Kelly diagnosed anxiety and depression attributed to workplace stress, and recommended a rehabilitation course and a gradual return to work on a part-time basis.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s94"">In the following month, October 2000, Dr Ridgway (who had by then replaced Dr Nelson at the general practice which the complainant visited) reported to the workers compensation insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s95"">The tribunal noted that Dr Ridgway found the complainant to be partially disabled, but able to return to work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s96"">She advised against returning to his former employment.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s97"">18 On 15 February 2001, Dr Mendelson again saw the complainant, and on that day reported to the workers compensation insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s98"">According to the tribunal, Dr Mendelson diagnosed a mild anxiety state, and was of the opinion that the complainant could work full time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s99"">Dr Mendelson's own report states that there was no indication that the complainant had any loss of work capacity, despite his continuing mild symptoms of anxiousness.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s100"">He added that the complainant required ongoing assistance in trying to secure employment consistent with his previous work experience and qualifications.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s101"">In February 2001, the complainant was also seen by Dr Strauss, a consultant psychiatrist.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s102"">According to the tribunal, Dr Strauss found that the complainant was not totally and permanently disabled, and was fit to work, but was not fit to return to his previous employment.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s103"">In his report, Dr Strauss said that he did not believe that the complainant had a psychiatric illness as such, and believed that his condition was well controlled.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s104"">He said that the complainant did have a permanent incapacity for employment because of his employment with the employer, and that the complainant had a work-related incapacity, and was not capable of pre-injury employment.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s105"">On the other hand, Dr Strauss said that the complainant was not 'totally incapacitated'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s106"">19 Dr Jakobovits, a gastro-enterologist, examined the complainant on 6 April 2001.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s107"">He expressed an opinion as to the relationship between the stress experienced by the complainant and his perforated ulcer, but, as the tribunal noted, gave no opinion regarding employability.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s108"">20 On 8 May 2001 the complainant was seen by Dr Epstein, a psychiatrist.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s109"">The tribunal noted that Dr Epstein assessed the complainant's psychiatric impairment at 15% and his physical impairment at 5%, concluding that the complainant's work capacity was limited by both psychiatric and physical factors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s110"">On this subject, Dr Epstein's report noted that the complainant had 'a psychiatric impairment of 20%, of which 5% relates to the concern over his congenital condition, which is not work-related'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s111"">Dr Epstein said that the work-related psychiatric impairment was 15%.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s112"">He said that his current work capacity was limited to some degree by his psychiatric state, and also by a non-work-related physical condition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s113"">21 The applicant himself obtained two reports in June 2001.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s114"">The first was from Dr Hewett, who had replaced Dr Ridgway as the complainant's general practitioner, who referred to certain physical conditions from which the complainant suffered, and who expressed the opinion that the complainant could not cope with any positions at his old company, because of past events.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s115"">He said that the complainant could not manage such jobs as accounts clerk, market research interviewing, dispatch clerk, or ticket salesperson.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s116"">He expressed the view that the only appropriate jobs for the complainant would be low stress and part-time clerical positions, and that he would not be able to consider even those positions for the next 6 to 12 months at least.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s117"">The other report of June 2001 was a further report from the psychologist, Dr O'Kelly.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s118"">The tribunal noted that Dr O'Kelly advised that the complainant could not resume work, or undertake rehabilitation, as the thought of both of those recommendations markedly increased his level of anxiety.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s119"">Dr O'Kelly expressed the view that the complainant was 'currently incapable of returning to employment'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s120"">22 On 26 June 2001, the complainant's solicitors applied, on his behalf, for a TPD benefit from the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s121"">Their letter enclosed four documents: an employee statement; an initial medical report; a certified copy of proof of age document; and a medical certificate from Dr Hewett dated 29 January 2001.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s122"">The employee statement was on a pro-forma supplied by the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s123"">The first item of information inserted on the form on behalf of the complainant was the name of the plan under which the complainant was submitting the claim, namely, the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s124"">For the reason he ceased work, the complainant stated: ""Work related stress caused by abuse from two general managers, to myself and my assistant which was reported to managing director and on file at Workcover Authority.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s125"">""",
"As to the exact nature of the injury or illness, the complainant stated 'work-related stress and secondary depressive illness'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s126"">He said that the injury or illness first occurred on 3 March 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s127"">He stated his education level, namely, 'Senior Cambridge Leaving Certificate (equiv 1 st yr. Uni)' and 'Certificate of Business Studies (3 yr Cert)'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s128"">He said that he was an associate senior member of the Australian Institute of Credit Management.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s129"">He gave his other training or skills as 'Microsoft Excel/Word/Internet'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s130"">He set out his employment history, including the fact that he had been a credit manager with the employer since 1991.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s131"">With this form, the complainant included a list of employment positions for which he had applied (or for which applications had been made on his behalf) since July 2000.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s132"">",
" 23 The 'Initial Medical Report' included with the solicitors' letter of 26 June 2001 was over the hand of Dr Hewett, and was dated 27 March 2001.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s135"">When asked to state what duties the complainant was unable to perform, Dr Hewett said 'totally incapacitated'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s136"">When asked when he expected the complainant to be fit to return to his normal work, Dr Hewett said 'will not return'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s137"">Dr Hewett was then asked to state why he thought that the complainant would never return to any type of work, and he said:",
" ""Suffers from anxiety/depression which is debilitating.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s139"">Probably could not cope with part-time work in future, even if available.</sentence>",

Dr Hewett recommended the application for disability benefits.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s142"">",
" 24 In July 2001, the fund provided an 'employer statement' to the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s143"">It said that the complainant was last actively at work on 19 May 1999, that the complainant ceased work 'due to work-related injury', that the complainant had had extensive experience as a credit manager, and that the employer had no alternative jobs available which were appropriate to the complainant's level of skill and experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s144"">25 As the forms to which I have referred suggest, the complainant's claim for a TPD benefit, and a corresponding employer statement, were forwarded to the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s145"">The insurer arranged for the complainant to be seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Sale.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s146"">In his report dated 19 March 2002, as the tribunal noted, Dr Sale found that the complainant was fit to return to work at that time, even as a credit manager, and on either a full-time or a part-time basis.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s147"">Dr Sale said that there was 'no psychiatric diagnoses warranted' and, when asked whether he considered that any treatment would be helpful, he stated that the complainant 'probably requires less treatment rather than more treatment'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s148"">Indeed, Dr Sale said he had gained the impression that 'some aspects of the treatment' may have impeded rather than furthered the prospects for rehabilitation.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s149"">26 By letter dated 17 April 2002 addressed to the fund, the complainant's claim was rejected by the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s150"">The insurer considered the employee statement, the employer statement, the initial medical report and certificate provided by Dr Hewett, and the report dated 19 March 2002 provided by Dr Sale.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s151"">The letter continued: ""The report from Dr I Sale Independent Psychiatrist notes the following: Mr Henderson was neatly presented, his affect was tense but otherwise unremarkable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s152"">There were no unusual features to his overall behaviour or thought process.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s153"">Cognitive functions were intact however, his personality was somewhat obsessional.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s154"">",
 Dr Sale notes that other than some anxiety about his current situation and the financial implications there is little to find clinically.</sentence>,

"<sentence id=""s156"">",

"<sentence id=""s161"">"" 27 Having considered the insurer's letter of 17 April 2002 and taken its own advice, on 2 August 2002 the trustee wrote to the complainant (by means of a letter on the trustee's behalf from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Pty Ltd).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s162"">The trustee said: ""The Trustee determined that, based on the evidence available, you do not satisfy the requirements of the Trust Deed and underlying insurance policy to be able to be paid a Total and Permanent Disablement benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s163"">""",

"The trustee said, for a TPD benefit to be paid, the conditions of the deed had to be satisfied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s164"">It referred to the provisions of the rules that specified the entitlement of a member of the fund in the event of the member being totally and permanently disabled (being the provisions to which I have referred in par 12 above), and to the definitions of TPD in each of the amended deed and the insurance policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s165"">The trustee continued:",
" ""AMP as insurer, has advised that based on its assessment of the claim, it is unable to admit a claim for Total and Permanent Disablement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s166"">""",
"The trustee then gave the complainant 28 days to submit further evidence to support his claim, failing which 'the trustee will treat the claim as denied'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s167"">There was no further evidence, and the claim was denied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s168"">",
 28 Three things may be noted about the trustee's letter of 2 August 2002.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s169"">First, the trustee referred only to the deed and rules as amended in November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s170"">It did not purport to decide the matter by reference to the rules in place on the last day the complainant worked, 19 May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s171"">Secondly, the trustee did not state, in terms, that it had decided that the complainant was not totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of the deed (even as amended).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s172"">As noted above, it said that the complainant did not satisfy the requirements of the deed to be able to be paid a TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s173"">This could have meant and, in the context of the response from the insurer which had recently been received, most probably did mean, no more than that the full amount of the TPD benefit under the deed could not be paid because there was no amount received from the insurer (see r 6.2 under the deed as amended as set out in par 12 above).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s174"">Thirdly, although the letter of 2 August 2002 stated that the trustee had considered the complainant's claim on 24 July 2002, by letter addressed to the tribunal dated 7 November 2003, the trustee said that there were no minutes of the meeting at which that consideration was undertaken, and that 'the decision was documented by letter to the complainant dated 2 August 2002'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s175"">29 By letter dated 7 February 2003, the complainant made a complaint to the trustee pursuant to arrangements which complied with s 101 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 ('the SIS Act').</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s176"">Enclosed with that complaint were two medical reports.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s177"">The first was a further report from Dr O'Kelly dated 1 November 2002, which the tribunal (referring also to a report from Dr O'Kelly made on 10 April 2004) said indicated that the complainant had deteriorated to such an extent that he was TPD and could not return to work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s178"">Dr O'Kelly's report of 1 November was, in fact, not quite so categorical.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s179"">She provided a formal diagnosis that the complainant had suffered 'a major depressive episode', she said that it was her impression that the complainant would not be able to manage working as a credit manager, she said that the complainant would have great difficulty managing the demands of employment that were appropriate to his levels of education and training and she said that she believed that the complainant would also have difficulty managing less demanding clerical tasks.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s180"">The second report was a further report from Dr Hewett dated 25 November 2002.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s181"">The tribunal said that this report was 'non-contributory' although it noted that Dr Hewett had declared the complainant to be totally unfit for any form of work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s182"">In the report, Dr Hewett said that the complainant was suffering from anxiety and depression, and made the comment that, while the 'Workcare pressures continued' the complainant's condition would not satisfactorily resolve.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s183"">On the balance of probabilities, Dr Hewett said that the complainant would never again be capable of performing the job of a group national credit manager, and was totally unfit for that position.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s184"">He continued: ""In view of his education, past training and experience, I do not believe he could move into any other suitable employment now or in the near future.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s185"">He is certainly not suitable for retraining now, owing to his emotional problems, and I believe this will continue to be the case in the foreseeable future.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s186"">"" 30 The trustee referred the complainant's letter of 7 February 2003, with enclosures, to the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s187"">These were in turn referred by the insurer to Dr Sale, for a further opinion.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s188"">In a report to the insurer dated 16 June 2003, Dr Sale said that there was nothing in the further material that caused him to alter his previous opinion (given in March 2002).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s189"">He considered that the complainant had 'received excessive psychological treatment that has caused him to perceive himself as psychologically fragile and an invalid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s190"">' He continued: ""At the most, I consider that Mr Henderson could be diagnosed as suffering from an adjustment disorder.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s191"">It is certainly not a serious psychiatric condition such as major depression.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s192"">",
" There are a number of issues that will act against Mr Henderson is [sic] resuming work (eg his age, being a workers compensation claimant, his long absence from work, his perception of himself as an invalid and his family difficulties).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s193"">However, I do not accept that he is totally and permanently impaired as a result of the clinical illness that would cause him to be unlikely ever to be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he is reasonably suited by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s194"">"" 31 By letter date 9 September 2003 to the trustee, the insurer referred to Dr Sale's most recent report, and said that there was no basis to consider that the complainant was TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s195"">It said that the insurer was 'comfortable with upholding the original denial decision'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s196"">By letter dated 16 October 2003 to the complainant, the trustee said that it had, at a meeting held on 14 October resolved, 'that their original decision to deny the claim be affirmed'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s197"">32 On 17 March 2004, the complainant applied to the trustee for a further review of its decision not to grant him a TPD benefit, and enclosed a report from Dr Ots.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s198"">On 28 June 2004, the trustee notified the complainant that it had resolved to affirm its original decision to deny the complainant's claim.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s199"">On 15 July 2004, the complainant applied again to the trustee for a review of its decision to deny him a TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s200"">He enclosed a report from Dr O'Kelly dated 10 April 2004, and a report from Dr Hewett dated 5 July 2004.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s201"">On 8 November 2004 the insurer advised the trustee that it did not propose to change its previous decision regarding the complainant, and on 30 November 2004, the trustee again advised the complainant that it had affirmed its original decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s202"">The three medical reports to which I have referred in this paragraph generally supported the complainant's claim that he was totally and permanently disabled, but I do not believe I need to say anything further about them in these reasons.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s203"">",
" THE COMPLAINT IN THE TRIBUNAL 33 On 31 July 2003, the complainant lodged the complaint with the tribunal which lead to the present appeal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s204"">The complainant was permitted to proceed in this way under s 19 of the Complaints Act, notwithstanding that his complaint to the trustee under s 101 of the SIS Act remained unresolved.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s205"">In his complaint form, the complainant said: ""On the basis of my claim and the material provided in support, I have satisfied the definition of disability under the Superannuation Scheme and/or insurance policy and the refusal/failure to pay the disability benefit is unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s206"">"" 34 Before proceeding to consider the progress of the complainant's complaint within the tribunal, I should note some features of the statutory framework under which the tribunal operated.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s207"">The particular complaint was made under s 14 of the Complaints Act, which applies 'if the trustee of a fund has made a decision ... in relation to ... a particular member ... of a regulated superannuation fund'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s208"">The ground upon which such a complaint may be made is 'that the decision is or was unfair or unreasonable'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s209"">Because the complaint in the present case related to a disability benefit under a contract of insurance between the trustee and the insurer, the tribunal was empowered under s 18(1)(c) of the Complaints Act to decide that the insurer should be a party to the complaint.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s210"">I note that, on 13 August 2003, the insurer was joined as a party in the present case.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s211"">35 The powers of the tribunal, in a complaint under s 14 of the Complaints Act, are set out in s 37 of that Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s212"">In such a situation, the tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s213"">In a case in which an insurer has been joined as a party, the tribunal must, when reviewing the trustee's decision, also review any relevant decision of the insurer and, for that purpose, has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s214"">Subsections (3)-(6) of s 37 are important in the present case, and I shall set them out in full: ""(3) On reviewing the decision of a trustee, insurer or other decision-maker that is the subject of, or relevant to, a complaint under section 14, the Tribunal must make a determination in writing: (a) affirming the decision; or (b) remitting the matter to which the decision relates to the trustee, insurer or other decision-maker for reconsideration in accordance with the directions of the Tribunal; or (c) varying the decision; or (d) setting aside the decision and substituting a decision for the decision so set aside.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s215"">",
" (4) The Tribunal may only exercise its determination-making power under subsection (3) for the purpose of placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in such a position that the unfairness, unreasonableness, or both, that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint no longer exists.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s216"">",
" (5) The Tribunal must not do anything under subsection (3) that would be contrary to law, to the governing rules of the fund concerned and, if a contract of insurance between an insurer and trustee is involved, to the terms of the contract.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s217"">",
" (6) The Tribunal must affirm a decision referred to under subsection (3) if it is satisfied that the decision, in its operation in relation to: (a) the complainant; and (b) so far as concerns a complaint regarding the payment of a death benefit--any person (other than the complainant, a trustee, insurer or decision-maker) who: (i) has become a party to the complaint; and (ii) has an interest in the death benefit or claims to be, or to be entitled to benefits through, a person having an interest in the death benefit; was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s218"">"" 36 It should be noted from these provisions that the obligation of the tribunal is to review the decision of the trustee and the insurer, and that the tribunal is obliged to make a determination of some kind.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s219"">In practice, it would seem that, in most cases --- and certainly in the present case --- the tribunal is required to consider first whether the decision under review was 'fair and reasonable in the circumstances', and if satisfied that it was, is required to affirm that decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s220"">That may not exhaust the tribunal's powers of affirmation under s 37, but however that may be, if the tribunal decides to make a determination other than one of affirmation, it must do so with a view to placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in such a position that the unfairness, unreasonableness, or both, that the tribunal has determined to exist no longer exist.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s221"">37 Returning to the course of the complaint in the present case, the tribunal held a meeting to review the decision of the trustee on 22 February 2005, and announced its decision, and determinations, on 13 May 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s222"">It determined the matter on the papers without a hearing.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s223"">The tribunal determined that the relevant version of the deed was that which in fact applied when the complainant ceased work, 19 May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s224"">The tribunal referred to the relevant provisions of the trust deed and of the insurance policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s225"">As to the latter, it referred to the definition of 'date of disablement' in the previous policy made in 1993.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s226"">No party was able to explain why the tribunal made this reference.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s227"">38 The tribunal then referred to the actual background of the complaint, and to the medical reports which were in evidence before it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s228"">It referred to the submissions, and to the reply submissions, of the complainant, the trustee and the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s229"">It then referred, under a heading in these terms, to the 'complainant's education, training and experience'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s230"">39 The tribunal then commenced its consideration of the matter before it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s231"">It said: ""The question is not whether the Tribunal would reach a different decision on the material before it, but is rather addressed to assessing the reasonableness and fairness of the Trustee and Insurer's decisions.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s232"">""",
"In this, the tribunal was clearly correct.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s233"">The tribunal next considered 'which definition of TPD should the trustee have used in its decision to deny the complainant's claim'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s234"">It held that the correct version was the deed applicable at the time the complainant ceased working.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s235"">This was May, not November, 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s236"">Then the tribunal considered whether the trustee had made a determination to modify the definition of TPD and the deed in accordance with the proviso in the definition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s237"">I shall say something further about this point below, as it was a matter relied upon by the trustee before me.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s238"">The tribunal held that there had been no such modification, and that the definition of TPD in the deed was that which is set out before the proviso.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s239"">",
 40 The tribunal then turned its attention away from the trustee's obligations under the deed to the insurer's obligations under the policy.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s240"">For reasons which will appear, it is necessary to set out a lengthy passage from the tribunal's reasons in which it affirmed the decision of the insurer: ""For the insurer the correct date for assessment is six months [after] the date on which the Complainant finished work as the result of the claimed illness, ie 19 November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s241"">",
" Those medical practitioners who reported in 1999 and early 2000, all found the Complainant was able to work full-time, although return to work with the Employer was to be avoided as such re-exposure had the potential to reactivate his anxiety state.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s242"">The Tribunal notes that the Complainant ceased work on 19 May 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s243"">",
" Dr MK in September 2000 recommended a gradual return to work programme, initially part-time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s244"">Dr RR (GP) on 17 October 2000 declared the Complainant not to be totally and permanently disabled and Dr NS on 21 November 2001 made the same assessment but advised against a return to work with the Employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s245"">",
 Dr RH declared the Complainant to be TPD on 27 March 2001 but on 25 June 2001 assessed the Complainant as fit for part-time work in a low stress environment.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s246"">On 25 November 2002, Dr RH found the Complainant to be totally and permanently unfit for work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s247"">",
" In 2004, Drs MK and PO declared the Complainant to be TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s248"">",
" At the time the Complainant ceased work and for the ensuing 10 months, no reporting medical practitioner found the Complainant unable to work or to be TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s249"">It has been suggested (Dr IS --- report of 14 March 2004) that the Complainant's excessive psychiatric/psychological treatment has led him to be believe that he is psychological invalid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s250"">",
 At the time the Complainant ceased work and for 10 months thereafter there is no medical opinion that he was unable to work full-time.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s251"">",
" There is a distinction between a person believing he/she is TPD and that person, in fact being TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s252"">",
 The distinction exists regardless of whether the belief is reasonably held as the result of the professional treatment given or not.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s253"">In the present case, having regard to both: (a) there being no medical opinion supportive of the Complainant being unable to work full time at the time he ceased work and for the 10 month period thereafter; and (b) the opinion of Dr IS that it is the Complainant's excessive treatment which has led him to believe that he is a psychological invalid, it was open to the Insurer to decide that the Complainant's disablement did not occur while the Complainant was in the active service of the Employer as is required by Clause 1(3) of the definition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s254"">Further, while the preponderance of the medical opinion was that the Complainant ought not return to his previous Employer, it was, on the information contained in the medical reports, not unfair and unreasonable for the Insurer to conclude that the Complainant would be able to obtain regular remunerative work for which he is reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s255"">It is not necessarily the case that, according to the definition contained in the Insurance Policy, that that work be remunerated at the same level of remuneration the Complainant was receiving at the time he worked for the Employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s256"">The only requirement arising from the Insurance definition is that that work be ""regular"" which in the context, the Tribunal understands to be a reference to the Complainant working full time as he was at the time he ceased work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s257"">""",
,
"In the light of these considerations, the tribunal held that the decision of the insurer to deny the TPD benefit should be affirmed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s258"">",
 41 The tribunal then returned to the obligation of the trustee under the deed.</sentence>,

"<sentence id=""s260"">It continued: ""While somewhat cumbersome, the Tribunal takes the proviso to mean that if the member, as the result of the disability, is unlikely to be able to obtain employment in the area in which he/she is qualified at a rate remunerated at the rate previously paid by the Employer, then that Member would be entitled to receive a TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s261"">A fair reading of the medical reports would reasonably lead the Trustee to the conclusion that the Complainant, even if he could obtain work with another employer, needed to be in a less stressful position than the position he occupied prior to his finishing work with the Employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s262"">At that time, he was the Group National Credit Manager for the Employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s263"">While there is no specific evidence available on the point, common sense would, given the nature of the Complainant's disability, result in a reasonable trustee concluding that it would be unlikely that the Complainant would be able to obtain employment at that level of remuneration which involved less stress.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s264"">As is apparent, the Trustee did not reach such a decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s265"">Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Trustee's decision was unfair and unreasonable in its operation in relation to the Complainant in the circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s266"">The Trustee should have determined the Complainant was entitled to be paid the TPD benefit.</sentence>",

,
"In the circumstances, the tribunal decided that the decision of the trustee ought to be set aside and a decision substituted that the complainant was entitled to be paid the TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s268"">",
" 42 The tribunal then considered the provisions of the deed (Sch 10 and Sch 7 as referred to above) which set out the components of the TPD benefit that ought, in the tribunal's view, to have been paid to the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s269"">It noted that there were no 'proceeds' of the policy which could be paid to the complainant (since it had affirmed the decision of the insurer to reject the claim under the policy).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s270"">The tribunal then said: ""Since, as the Tribunal has found, the Trustee did not modify the definition contained in the Trust Deed to accord with that found in the policy and the Trustee did not explain the limitations of the policy requirements applicable to TPD claims, it was not unreasonable for the Complainant to conclude that the Trust Deed definition of TPD would result in his having insured coverage on the same basis as provided in the Trust Deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s271"">Had the Trustee drawn the discrepancy to his attention or modified the Trust Deed definition to comply with the definition contained in the Insurance Policy, the outcome may well have been different.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s272"">But it did not, and as a result, the Trustee, in order to rectify the resulting unfairness and unreasonableness, ought to have given consideration to the exercise of the power contained in Article 4.7 of the Trust Deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s273"">For the Trustee not to have done so renders its decision unfair and unreasonable in its operation to the Complainant in the circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s274"">",
" The Tribunal, standing in the shoes of the Trustee (see s.37(1) of the Complaints Act) and exercising the power of the Trustee, determines, in order to place the Complainant as nearly as practicable in a position that the unfairness and unreasonableness that the Tribunal has found to exist (s.37(4) of the Complaints Act), that the Trustee pay the amount of insured benefit the Complainant would have received had the Insurer been obliged to pay under the Policy with interest at the rate the Insurer would have bee obliged to pay under s.57 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 from 10 April 2004, that being the date of the latest medical report form the Complainant to the Trustee, to the date of payment.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s275"">"" 43 As is apparent from the above, the tribunal's reasoning involved the following elements.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s276"">First, under the policy, it had not been established that it was unlikely that the complainant would ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s277"">In the circumstances, the decision of the insurer to decline the claim under the policy was fair and reasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s278"">Secondly, under the deed, it was unlikely that any future occupation in which the complainant might be engaged would provide him with an equivalent level of remuneration to that which he had received in his employment with the employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s279"">Accordingly, the complainant ought to have been regarded as totally and permanently disabled, and to have been entitled to a TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s280"">The decision of the trustee to the contrary was unfair and unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s281"">Thirdly, a significant element of the TPD benefit payable under the deed was the proceeds of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s282"">As a result of the (fair and reasonable) decision of the insurer, there were no such proceeds.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s283"">Despite the fact that he ought to have been held to be totally and permanently disabled, the complainant did not, therefore, receive the full TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s284"">Fourthly, the tribunal had an obligation under s 37 of the Complaints Act to make a determination which, as nearly as practicable, placed the complainant in a position which was no longer affected by the unfairness and unreasonableness of the trustee's decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s285"">Fifthly, the tribunal, standing in the shoes of the trustee, had all the powers which the trustee had when it rejected the complainant's claim.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s286"">One of those powers was that arising under r 4.7 of the rules, namely, the power, in the absolute discretion of the trustee, to 'pay to a member at any time any amount'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s287"">This power should be exercised to require the trustee to pay, from its own resources, the amount of the insured benefit which the complainant would have received had the insurer been obliged to pay under the policy, together with interest under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s288"">44 As is clear from the provisions of the Complaints Act to which I have referred, the trustee was obliged to resolve the complaint before it by determination.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s289"">What I have referred to as the tribunal's decision of 13 May 2005 is a fourteen page document headed 'Review Determination and Reasons'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s290"">A reading of that document discloses the following determinations under s 37(3) of the Complaints Act: &#8226; A determination to affirm the decision of the insurer upon the ground that that decision was, in its operation, fair and reasonable in the circumstances;",
 &#8226; A determination to set aside the decision of the trustee upon the ground that that decision was unfair and unreasonable in the circumstances;,
 &#8226; A determination to substitute for the decision of the trustee a decision that the complainant was entitled to be paid the TPD benefit by the trustee;,
" &#8226; A determination, in compliance with subs (4), that the trustee pay the amount of the insured benefit that the complainant would have received had the insurer been obliged to pay under the insurance policy, with interest at the rate the insurer would have been obliged to pay under s 57 of the Insurance Contracts Act from 10 April 2004.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s291"">",
" THE TRUSTEE'S APPEAL 45 It was submitted by Mr Hanks QC, who appeared for the trustee, that the tribunal's determinations involved various errors of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s292"">First, he submitted that it was an error for the tribunal to have held that the version of the deed and rules under which the complainant's entitlement should have been assessed was that which existed in May 1999, when the complainant last worked.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s293"">Mr Hanks submitted that the trustee was obliged to operate by reference to the version of the deed and rules which was current when the complainant submitted his TPD claim on 26 June 2001.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s294"">By then, the deed and rules had been amended in November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s295"">Mr Bingham, who appeared for the complainant, submitted that, when the complainant retired from service on the ground of permanent disablement --- which he said, and the trustee accepted, occurred in May 1999 --- he was thereupon entitled to the benefit of the operation of r 4.3 of the rules as existed at that time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s296"">It was immaterial, he submitted, that the request for that benefit was made some time later.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s297"">Mr Hanks responded with a submission in the alternative, based on Recital F of the amending deed of 26 November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s298"">He submitted that, even if the date at which the complainant's entitlement was to be determined was May 1999, the amendments to the deed operated retrospectively from 1 July 1996, with the result that it was the amended deed which defined that entitlement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s299"">Mr Bingham rejoined with a reference to reg 13.16(1) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 , which made it a standard of regulated superannuation funds that a beneficiary's right or claim to accrued benefits, and the amount of those benefits, must not be altered adversely to the beneficiary by amendments of the governing rules of the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s300"">On both of these aspects, I accept Mr Bingham's submission.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s301"">Assuming for the purposes of argument that the complainant did retire on 19 May 1999 on the ground of permanent disablement, I consider that r 4.3 in its amended form gave rise to an immediate entitlement to be paid the TPD benefit for which the rules then made provision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s302"">Likewise, by the operation of reg 13.16, if the complainant in fact had such an immediate entitlement when he retired, no subsequent amendment of the deed could retrospectively affect that entitlement detrimentally to the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s303"">I do not believe that this aspect of the tribunal's decision involved any error of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s304"">46 Mr Hanks next submitted that r 4.3 in its unamended form was not sufficient to deliver to the complainant the benefit of the insurance policy because, even if it be accepted that the complainant retired on the ground of permanent disablement, there were no proceeds of the insurance policy which could be applied for the complainant's benefit in accordance with the provisions of Sch 7 and Sch 10 to which I have referred in par 6 above.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s305"">That proposition appears to be sound, and to have been recognised as such by the tribunal, since the tribunal found it necessary to exercise the trustee's power under r 4.7 of the rules to determine that there be a discretionary payment made to the complainant in an amount equal to that which he would have received had he been totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s306"">At this level, according to the submission of Mr Hanks, it was no longer possible to treat the unamended version of the deed and rules as applicable, since r 4.7 (unlike r 4.3) did not speak as at the date of the complainant's retirement from service: it invested the trustee with a discretion to make an exceptional payment and, necessarily, spoke as at the date when that discretion came to be exercised.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s307"">That date was well after the amendments to the deed and rules in November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s308"">Neither r 4.7, nor anything closely approximating that rule, survived those amendments.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s309"">Mr Hanks submitted that it was an error of law for the tribunal to have proceeded on the basis that r 4.7 was available to the trustee in June 2001 when the complainant lodged his application, or at any time thereabouts.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s310"">For his part, Mr Bingham submitted that r 4.7 was expressed to be an overriding provision, and that the trustee had an absolute discretion under that rule.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s311"">47 Under s 37(1)(a) of the Complaints Act, the tribunal had all the powers, obligations and discretions that were conferred on the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s312"">I am prepared to read this provision in the sense of conferring on the tribunal the powers etc that the trustee had at the time of its own decision under the rules of the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s313"">As I have indicated, the tribunal decided that the trustee, having found (as it should have) that the complainant was totally and permanently disabled, and having noted (as it did) that r 4.3 would not deliver to the complainant the proceeds of any insurance policy, should then have concluded that the unfairness of such an outcome could and should be rectified under r 4.7.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s314"">In other words, in the tribunal's thinking, r 4.7 should have been brought into play when the trustee made its own decision as to the complainant's entitlement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s315"">This could not have been earlier than the date upon which the insurer advised the trustee that it had denied the claim under the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s316"">This was much later than 26 November 1999, when r 4.7 was, by amendment, removed from the deed and the rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s317"">At the time when, according to the tribunal, the trustee should have acted under r 4.7, the rule was gone.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s318"">Regulation 13.16(1) is of no benefit to the complainant in this respect, as on no view could the possibility that the trustee might make a discretionary payment to him in excess of his entitlement be regarded as an 'accrued benefit'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s319"">For these reasons, I consider that the tribunal's determination that it was unfair and unreasonable for the trustee not to have resorted to r 4.7 to make a payment to the complainant equivalent to that which he would have received under the policy was erroneous.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s320"">The error involved was one of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s321"">48 Mr Bingham submitted that, if cl 4.7 of the original rules was not available at the time the trustee made its decision, a similar result was achievable by recourse to the trustee's powers under cl 11.4 of the amended deed, to the relevant provisions of which I have referred in par 11 above.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s322"">If this was so, it would not affect that conclusion I have reached above which was concerned with what the tribunal actually did, rather than with what it might have done.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s323"">However, Mr Bingham submitted that, if I were of the view that the trustee had made an error of law in relying upon cl 4.7, I should remit the matter to the tribunal for consideration of the question whether a like result might have been achieved under cl 11.4 of the amended deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s324"">I could take that course only if I was of the view that the payment of a sum equivalent to the permanent disablement benefit under the original rules would have been a regular and lawful exercise of the trustee's powers under cl 11.4 of the amended deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s325"">I do not believe that it would.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s326"">Paragraphs (a) and (b) of cl 11.4 are, in my opinion, empowering rather than entitling; that is to say, they give the trustee the usual range of functional powers to do various things in furtherance of its responsibilities under the deed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s327"">Although the trustee would have power under cl 11.4, for example, to compromise a claim, that power, in my view, would not make it lawful for the trustee to pay to a member of the fund a sum to which the member was not entitled, or to pay out of the fund, in its discretion, a sum which was not referable to a member's entitlement, or at least lying along the axis of a potential entitlement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s328"">On the facts of this case, I do not believe it would be consistent with the amended deed for the trustee to purport to exercise its power under cl 11.4 thereof because the sum to which the complainant was entitled as at May 1999 under the original rules fell short of what the trustee considered, in its discretion, to be a fair and reasonable payment in the circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s329"">If follows that, under s 37(5) of the Complaints Act, it would not have been within the power of the tribunal to have had recourse to cl 11.4 of the amended deed for that purpose.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s330"">49 Mr Hanks next argued that, if recourse to cl 4.7 of the original rules had been available to the trustee as a matter of timing in the present case, it would have constituted a breach of trust for the trustee to have made the payment thereunder that the tribunal held to constitute a fair and reasonable outcome in the circumstances of the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s331"">Mr Hanks' proposition was that all moneys held in the fund, whether they represented member contributions, employer contributions or profit, had to be allocated to members of the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s332"">He submitted that, for the trustee to have made a payment to the complainant under cl 4.7 (being a payment to which he was, by definition, not otherwise entitled and which, also by definition, went beyond the moneys that had been allocated to him) would necessarily have required the trustee to draw upon moneys in the fund which had been allocated to other members.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s333"">In an accumulation superannuation fund which complies with the requirements of the SIS Act, these propositions sound as though they ought to be correct, but, on analysis, they involve a number of assumptions of fact in relation to matters which were not dealt with by the tribunal, and not thoroughly explored in the evidence before the court.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s334"">There was no provision of the original rules which, in terms, directly required the trustee to allocate every incoming dollar to the account of one or other of the members.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s335"">It is true that the provisions of Sch 7 to the rules required the accumulated contributions made by a particular member, and by the employer with respect to that member, to be available for that member should an occasion arise when the 'accrued benefit' became payable to him or her.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s336"">However, Sch 7 did not, at least explicitly, require the trustee to build up the account of each member according only to the investment earnings of the accumulated amount of the contributions which had been made in relation to him or her.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s337"">Rather, the trustee was required to add to each member's account an amount representing a share of the profit for the financial year to date.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s338"">The rules left much unexplained as to how the 'profit' would be derived in a particular case.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s339"">The rules otherwise made provision for the trustee to meet expenses from time to time (presumably including, as Mr Bingham pointed out, the costs of conducting litigation such as this), and those expenses would have had to have come from somewhere.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s340"">Likewise, the trustee was empowered to make such provision as it thought fit for 'any particularly adverse or favourable circumstances known to the trustee'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s341"">I do not believe that these and other questions have been sufficiently investigated, either in point of fact or in point of law, for me to hold that recourse to r 4.7 in the way proposed by the tribunal would necessarily have been a breach of trust for the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s342"">Since I have decided that cl 4.7 was not, in any event, available in the particular circumstances of the complainant, for me to decide the breach of trust point would be to go beyond what was necessary to resolve the matter before the court and that consideration, together with the others referred to in this paragraph, leads me to the conclusion that I should not attempt to make a finding on this aspect of Mr Hanks' submissions.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s343"">50 Mr Hanks' next submission was that, even if r 4.7 was otherwise available, and if recourse to it would not have amounted to a breach of trust, the way the tribunal in fact used the rule in the circumstances before it did not constitute a bona fide exercise of the tribunal's discretion in that regard.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s344"">He submitted that, in point of fact, there were no funds available for a payment to be made under r 4.7, because all funds had been allocated to the accounts of various members.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s345"">As will be apparent, this is a variation of the submission with which I have most recently dealt, and one which required consideration of facts and circumstances which were not before the tribunal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s346"">As such, the point could not reveal an error of law, a circumstance which Mr Hanks accepted.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s347"">He submitted, however, that the reason that the necessary facts were not before the tribunal was that the tribunal had given no indication that it might resolve the matter before it by reference to r 4.7 (and the complainant had not based his complaint upon that rule).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s348"">This took Mr Hanks to another point which he developed later, namely, that the trustee had been denied natural justice by the tribunal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s349"">That is a matter to which I shall turn, but it is clear that the particular point to which the present submission relates cannot, of itself, be regarded as demonstrating an error of law on the part of the tribunal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s350"">51 Mr Hanks next pointed to the proviso in the definition of 'total and permanent disablement' in the original rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s351"">He submitted that the trustee had effected a policy in relation to the complainant, and had determined that the meaning of TPD was identical to the circumstances in which an amount was payable under the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s352"">If sound, this submission would mean that, instead of the definition of TPD set out in par 7 above, the rules would, in effect, be deemed to contain the definition of TPD set out in the policy (see par 14 above) and, therefore, that there could never be the kind of discrepancy between the outcomes under the two different definitions which the tribunal held to have arisen in the present case.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s353"">A similar submission was made to the tribunal, and it decided the matter as follows: ""The next issue is whether or not the Trustee made a determination to modify the Trust Deed definition to make it identical with the definition contained in the Insurance Policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s354"">The Tribunal notes the wording of the definition requires the Trustee to make a decision ""in respect of the Member"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s355"">This indicates that an individual decision would need to be made with respect to each member to whom the Trustee determined the modification would apply.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s356"">The definition does not contemplate the adoption of an overall policy approach to enable the Trustee to make the modification in respect of all members.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s357"">In any event, the mere adoption of a policy to apply the modification does not amount to such a determination.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s358"">The wording relied on by the Trustee in the Booklet (quoted earlier) does not establish notification to members that the Trustee has reached any such determination.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s359"">It merely recites the requirements of the Insurer in its assessment of claims under the definition in the Insurance Policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s360"">""",
The tribunal held that the definition of TPD in the rules had not been modified.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s361"">",
" 52 To the extent that the tribunal held that the power of modification contained in the proviso to the definition of TPD in the original rules could be exercised only with respect to each member individually, and not across the population of members of the fund as a whole, I am inclined to think that too narrow a view of that power was taken.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s362"">It is, however, undesirable that I say anything further on that subject, since the tribunal's alternative basis for rejecting the trustee's submission, as set out in the passage quoted above, was purely factual, and was sufficient, of itself, to justify that rejection.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s363"">It was clearly open to the tribunal to find, as a matter of fact, that the terms of the member booklet did not constitute a determination under the proviso to the definition of TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s364"">In these circumstances, I would hold that the tribunal's decision that the definition was not modified was not affected by any relevant error of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s365"">53 Mr Hanks next submitted that, when properly understood, the tribunal's decision discloses that the real element of unfairness and unreasonableness upon which it made its determination did not relate to the decision of the trustee at all, but related to quite different facts and circumstances, and, therefore, that the tribunal had gone outside its mandate under s 37 of the Complaints Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s366"">Mr Hanks pointed to the tribunal's conclusion that the decision of the trustee that the complainant was not entitled to a TPD benefit was unfair and unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s367"">That decision, he submitted, was the only one which the trustee made in relation to the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s368"">Had it made what the tribunal regarded as the only fair and reasonable decision in the circumstances, it would have held that the complainant was entitled to a TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s369"">Mr Hanks submitted that such a decision would have left the complainant in precisely the same situation as that in which he in fact found himself, namely, a situation in which he was ostensibly paid a TPD benefit, but one which lacked the component constituted by the proceeds of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s370"">Mr Hanks pointed out that, in order to secure an outcome which would deliver to the complainant a benefit equivalent to that which he would have received had he been TPD under the policy, the tribunal was obliged to rely upon certain other acts and omissions of the trustee which had nothing to do with the decision the subject of the complaint.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s371"">Those acts and omissions were the trustee's failure to modify the definition in the rules to accord with that found in the policy, the trustee's failure to explain the limitations of the policy requirements applicable to TPD claims, and the trustee's failure to draw to the attention of the complainant the discrepancy between the two definitions of TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s372"">According to Mr Hanks, these were not elements of the trustee's decision at all, and in seeking to put them to rights, the tribunal had gone beyond the minimum necessary to place the complainant as nearly as practicable in a position in which the unfairness and unreasonableness determined to exist 'in relation to the trustee's decision', as required by s 37(4) of the Complaints Act, no longer existed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s373"">54 Mr Bingham responded to this submission by pointing out that the essence of the tribunal's reasoning was that the trustee ought to have appreciated that the receipt of a TPD benefit which did not include any element referable to the proceeds of the policy was manifestly unfair and unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s374"">Once it was accepted that the conclusion that the complainant was not totally and permanently disabled was unfair and unreasonable, it likewise followed, according to Mr Bingham, that for the complainant to receive anything less than was contemplated by the rules in the case of a member who was totally and permanently disabled would necessarily also be unfair and unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s375"">He submitted that this is precisely what the tribunal held, and that the holding involved no error of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s376"">55 I consider that the first part of Mr Hanks' submission is sound.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s377"">The complainant's complaint related only to the decision of the trustee communicated by letter dated 2 August 2002.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s378"">The tribunal held that it was unfair and unreasonable for the trustee to have decided that the complainant did not come within the definition of TPD in the rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s379"">It substituted its own decision that that the complainant was entitled to be paid the TPD benefit by the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s380"">However, in the circumstances of the complainant, that benefit had no component constituted by the proceeds of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s381"">That result was brought about by the terms of the policy, not by any decision of the trustee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s382"">It is the result which would have been ordained by the rules had the trustee decided, as the tribunal considered would have been fair and reasonable, that the complainant was entitled to the TPD benefit.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s383"">56 However, I do not consider that the second part of Mr Hanks' submission is sound.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s384"">It proceeds from a misunderstanding of the tribunal's decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s385"">It is true that the tribunal referred to other acts and omissions of the trustee --- its failure to modify the definition in the rules to accord with that found in the policy, its failure to explain the limitations of the policy requirements applicable to TPD claims, and its failure to draw to the attention of the complainant the discrepancy between the two definitions of TPD --- and held that there was a ""resulting unfairness and unreasonableness"" which needed to be ""rectified"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s386"">But it was not the unfairness and unreasonableness of these other acts and omissions, of themselves, that the tribunal addressed under s 37(4): it was the unfairness and unreasonableness of the trustee's failure, as part of its decision notified on 2 August 2002, to effect such a rectification by recourse to r 4.7 of the original rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s387"">I do not, therefore, consider that the tribunal's decision can be validly criticized on the ground that the tribunal sought to apply the remedial terms of s 37(4) to some act or omission other than the decision about which the complaint had been made.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s388"">57 Mr Hanks next submitted that the trustee had been denied procedural fairness by the tribunal, in that r 4.7 had not been relied on by the complainant, and the tribunal had said nothing to alert the trustee to the possibility that the matter before it might be resolved by recourse to r 4.7.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s389"">Mr Hanks relied upon the following words of the Full court, spoken with reference to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in Goldie v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 56 ALD 31, [35]: ""It is well-established that before the Tribunal is entitled to make a decision against a party on a basis entirely different than that relied on by the other party, it must give the person affected notice that it is considering whether to make a determination adverse to him on that particular basis and a reasonable opportunity to deal with the case the Tribunal is contemplating.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s394"">He referred to a submission made by the trustee to the tribunal that, under the fund rules, the maximum benefit that the trustee could pay to a fund member, in the event of TPD, could not be greater than the sum of the member's fund credit and the amount received from the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s395"">Mr Bingham submitted, in effect, that the trustee was implicitly recognising that a possible outcome to which it was potentially exposed was that the tribunal might well require it to pay the complainant a sum which was greater than his fund credit and the amount received from the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s396"">He submitted that, if so, r 4.7 would have been brought into play, and that the trustee ought to have been alive to this.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s397"">I note, however, that, when the complainant responded to the trustee's submission to which Mr Bingham referred, he said that the rules would allow the fund to compromise a claim made against it by a member in circumstances where the definition of TPD in the rules had been satisfied, but where there was no entitlement under the insurance policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s398"">59 The whole proceeding in the tribunal was conducted on the papers.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s399"">This gave the parties an opportunity to consider, with some accuracy, the range of matters that were advanced before the tribunal by the complainant and what, if any, indications were given by the tribunal as to how it might resolve the matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s400"">It is true that there was a certain confusion as to which version of the deed and rules should apply in the circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s401"">It seems that the complainant was working by reference to the original rules, while the trustee made its submissions throughout by reference to the rules as they had been amended in November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s402"">Both versions of the rules, however, gave the trustee power to compromise a claim.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s403"">As I have indicated above, this was a power which, in point of substance not merely procedure, differed from the power originally available under r 4.7.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s404"">The submissions made to the tribunal centred on the question whether the complainant met the definition of TPD.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s405"">That definition was relevant under r 4.7 of the original rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s406"">I am satisfied that the complainant only ever sought a TPD benefit from the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s407"">The kind of benefit for which r 4.7 of the rules provided was, in my view, 'entirely different' from that which the complainant sought.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s408"">It is also evident that the tribunal itself gave the trustee no inkling that it might have resort to r 4.7.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s409"">As is apparent from other sections of these reasons, it is probable that the trustee would have had a deal to say as to the availability of r 4.7 in the circumstances and, if it were available, as to the appropriateness of having resort to it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s410"">Although I have not ruled upon the trustee's arguments that resort to r 4.7 in the way done by the tribunal inevitably involved a breach of trust, it is apparent from the position taken by the trustee in this proceeding that it would have made a submission on the subject, had the tribunal given it the opportunity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s411"">I consider, in the circumstances, that the trustee was denied procedural fairness in relation to so much of the tribunal's determination as purported to exercise power under r 4.7 of the original rules.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s412"">60 In making a determination adverse to the trustee without according the trustee procedural fairness, the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction: [reference].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s413"">That being so, the determination was, in law, no determination at all: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476, 506.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s414"">The determination will have to be set aside on this ground.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s415"">61 I have held that the tribunal's recourse to r 4.7 of the original rules involved errors of law in two respects.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s416"">I shall set aside the relevant determination, and remit that matter to be determined again by the tribunal in accordance with these reasons.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s417"">The other determinations which the tribunal made adversely to the insurer will not be affected.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s418"">",
" THE COMPLAINANT'S CROSS APPEAL 62 In presenting the complainant's cross appeal, Mr Bingham submitted that the tribunal's determination to affirm the decision of the insurer was affected by errors of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s419"">He first submitted that it was an error of law for the tribunal to have held that the 'correct date for assessment' under the policy was six months after the date on which the complainant finished work, ie 19 November 1999.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s420"">He said that the defined term 'date of disablement' in the policy was relevant only for the purpose of identifying the date at which 'the amount of group life insurance' should be ascertained under cl 4.2 of the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s421"">He said that that term was irrelevant to the question whether a condition of TPD existed in relation to the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s422"">Mr Bingham submitted that the definition of TPD required that the complainant have been disabled while in the active service of the employer, that the disability have resulted from an illness, accident or injury, and that the disability have resulted in the complainant being continuously absent from his employment for at least six consecutive months.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s423"">Those conditions being satisfied, it was then necessary that the insurer have determined that it was unlikely that the complainant would ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s424"">None of this, according to Mr Bingham, mandated a particular date, being six months after the complainant last worked, at which the assessment should be made.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s425"">63 I do not understand Ms Alpins, who appeared for the insurer, to have taken issue with Mr Bingham's construction of the definition of TPD in the policy in this respect.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s426"">I shall return to what she did say about this point presently, but it is important to consider what that definition says, how it operates and whether it requires a decision to be made by the insurer at a particular point in time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s427"">Each of pars (1), (2) and (3) of the definition requires that a disablement 'occur' at a particular time identified by reference to other events or circumstances.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s428"">The third of those requirements is that the disablement have occurred 'while he is in the active service of the employer' (where active service is defined to include leave of absence with salary or wages and, in certain circumstances, other leave of absence).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s429"">That a disablement have occurred at this time, however, is not sufficient: it is necessary to turn to the first of the alternative requirements set out in the definition, that contained in par (a) thereof.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s430"">That requirement contains three cumulative elements, namely --- &#8226; that the disablement have resulted from an illness, accident or injury;",
 &#8226; that the disablement have resulted in the person concerned being continuously absent from his/her employment for at least six consecutive months commencing prior to his/her 65 th birthday; and,
" &#8226; that the insurer have determined that it is unlikely that the person concerned will ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he/she is reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s431"">",
,
,
It is evident that the earliest date upon which a disablement might become a TPD within the meaning of the definition is the last day of the six consecutive months referred to in the definition.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s432"">If the insurer has, on or before that day, made a determination of the kind to which the definition refers, the requirements of the definition will, on that day, have been satisfied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s433"">If the insurer has not then made such a determination, those requirements will not be satisfied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s434"">But the definition does not limit the period within which the insurer might make such a determination: it is not beyond the scope of the definition for the insurer, in a particular case, to make its determination months, or even years, after the last day of the six consecutive months.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s435"">",
" 64 On the matter of the insurer's determination, the definition uses the past tense ('has determined') but only in the context of treating such a determination, once made, as a condition which has been satisfied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s436"">When it speaks of the nature or quality of the matter to be determined, the definition is concerned with a present unlikelihood of something occurring in the future.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s437"">That is to say, the insurer must consider whether it is presently unlikely that the person concerned will ever again be able to engage in work of the kind described.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s438"">It follows that, when it considers whether to make a determination, the insurer must look at the facts as they present themselves at that time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s439"">It must consider all of the available material for the purposes of making a decision about the unlikelihood of the person ever engaging in work of the kind described.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s440"">For the insurer not to take this approach, but to have looked only at facts and circumstances as they existed some time previously, would not be in accordance with the definition of TPD in the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s441"">65 In the present case, the insurer made the decision in which it held that the complainant was not totally and permanently disabled within the definition of TPD on 17 April 2002.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s442"">Mr Bingham submitted that the insurer was obliged to consider all facts and circumstances as at that date when it came to address the question whether the complainant was unlikely ever again to engage in remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s443"">He said that, in his complaint before the tribunal, the complainant had submitted that the insurer's decision on 17 April 2002 was unfair and unreasonable, and that for the tribunal to have considered that complaint against a holding that the 'correct date for assessment' was 19 November 1999 was erroneous in point of law, in that it was contrary to the definition of TPD in the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s444"">66 Ms Alpins submitted that the question for the tribunal was not whether the insurer had been correct, in some absolute sense, in declining to be satisfied that the complainant was totally and permanently disabled within the terms of the definition, but whether the insurer's decision in that respect was unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s445"">She referred to a number of authorities in this court in support of the proposition, which I accept, that it is not the role of the tribunal to consider whether a decision under review in a s 37 proceeding was right or wrong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s446"">She also submitted that the tribunal's reasons should be read as a whole, and without using a fine appellate toothcomb or a disposition which is zealous to discern error in the actual terms in which the tribunal has chosen to express its reasoning.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s447"">I also accept these propositions.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s448"">Ms Alpins submitted that the tribunal's decision in the present case, read fairly and as a whole, disclosed that it had not confined itself to what she described as the second limb of the definition of TPD in the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s449"">When the tribunal's decision is read as a whole, she submitted, it is apparent that the tribunal had regard to all of the medical evidence and that it asked itself the right question, namely, whether the decision of the insurer was fair and reasonable in its operation.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s450"">67 Before considering this aspect further, I shall mention the second basis upon which Mr Bingham submitted that the tribunal had erred in point of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s451"">He pointed to the tribunal's holding that 'it was open to the Insurer to decide that the Complainant's disablement did not occur while the Complainant was in the active service of the Employer as is required by clause 1(3) of the definition'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s452"">As it happened, Mr Bingham submitted, the insurer never made any such decision: that the disablement occurred while the complainant was in the active service of the employer was never doubted.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s453"">The focus of the insurer's consideration was on the question whether the complainant was unlikely to be able to work again etc. Ms Alpins responded that the definition must be read as a whole, and that all the insurer had done was to decline to admit the claim in the case of the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s454"">As its letter dated 17 April 2002 indicated, all the evidence was reviewed against the policy definition of disablement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s455"">For the tribunal to have held that it was 'open' for the insurer to decide that the disablement did not occur whilst the complainant was in active service, was to do no more than to provide a basis upon which the insurer's decision should not be regarded as unfair or unreasonable in a particular respect.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s456"">She submitted that this aspect of the tribunal's reasons did not involve a question of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s457"">68 Conscious of the need to avoid using a fine appellate tooth comb, I think that Mr Bingham's two submissions should be considered together, at least initially.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s458"">The whole of the relevant part of the tribunal's reasons, set out in par 40 above, should be read with a view first to identifying what the tribunal meant and only then to asking whether an error of law was involved.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s459"">69 Having made its observation about 'the correct date for assessment', the tribunal noted that the medical practitioners who 'reported in 1999 and early 2000' all found that the complainant was able to work full-time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s460"">As it happens, there were only two practitioners who reported in 1999, and none reported in early 2000.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s461"">The two who reported in 1999 were Dr Garland and Dr Mendelson, who reported on 17 and 18 November 1999 respectively.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s462"">Each reported to the workers compensation insurer, and for purposes different from, although analogous to, those arising under the definition of TPD in the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s463"">Dr Garland said: ""From a psychiatric point of view he is now quite capable in my opinion both of pre-injury employment and also 'suitable employment' taking into account factors (a)-(f) relating to 'suitable employment"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s464"">",
,
,
"Manifestly, Dr Garland was concerned with the criteria for 'suitable employment' under s 5 of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 (Vic).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s465"">Dr Mendelson said:",
" ""In my opinion, once there has been some further improvement in Mr Henderson's anxiety symptoms he will be able to undertake a work trial in a position that is free of significant responsibility and time pressure, but at present he is quite resentful towards his employers, and unless his attitude changes an attempt to return to work with Auspine is likely to lead to an exacerbation of his feelings of anxiousness.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s466"">""",
,
"All of the other practitioners referred to by the tribunal in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs in the passage set out in par 40 above reported on the complainant's condition subsequent to '1999 and early 2000'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s467"">I note in passing that there appear to be some minor mistakes in the dates allocated by the tribunal to some of these reports: Dr Strauss (NS) reported on 21 February 2001, not 21 November 2001.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s468"">Dr Sale's second report was dated 16 June 2003, not 14 March 2004.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s469"">Nothing, however, appears to turn on these minor errors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s470"">",
" 70 Apparently, the tribunal was concerned to draw attention to the variations in the assessments which different practitioners had made of the complainant's condition at different times.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s471"">Amongst these assessments made in the first 10 months after the complainant ceased work, there were none which found the complainant to be unable to work full-time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s472"">There were later assessments, by contrast, which held the complainant to be totally and permanently disabled.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s473"">One of the latest assessments was that of the Dr Sale, who opined that excessive treatment had led the complainant to believe that he was a psychological invalid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s474"">In the light of all this, the tribunal pointed to the distinction between someone believing that he is, and that person actually being, totally and permanently disabled.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s475"">The tribunal may then have considered whether it was open to the insurer to consider that the complainant believed that he was totally and permanently disabled when in fact he was not.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s476"">For this purpose, the tribunal had regard to the matters referred to in the lettered subparas (a) and (b): the absence of medical opinion in the first 10 months which supported the TPD case and the fact that, due to excessive treatment, the complainant may have believed that he was a psychological invalid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s477"">Logically, the tribunal might then have considered that it would not have been unfair or unreasonable for the insurer to have, in effect, discounted the later medical assessments in its consideration of the TPD matter; or to have accepted Dr Sale's view that those assessments drew more upon the complainant's own belief as to his state of health than upon the objective medical facts.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s478"">In other words, had the tribunal said that it was open to the insurer, for those reasons, to decide that the complainant was not unlikely to find regular remunerative work for which he was fitted by education etc, the reasoning expressed thereby would have been logical.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s479"">However, the tribunal did not make such a statement (after subpara (b)).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s480"">Instead, it said that it was open to the insurer to decide that the complainant's disablement did not occur while he was in the active service of the employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s481"">It is not obvious why the tribunal made that statement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s482"">If it meant to convey that the insurer might, fairly and reasonably, have formed the view that the complainant was not rendered unable to work to the extent required by the definition of TPD during the time that he was in active service, that would have been to mis-state the requirements of the definition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s483"">As I have pointed out, the definition requires that the relationship between the disability and the complainant's likely inability to find work of the relevant kind be addressed as at the time that the insurer comes to consider the matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s484"">It is not disqualifying that the original disability would not then (ie during active service) have justified such a conclusion.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s485"">If, on the other hand, the tribunal meant to convey that the insurer might, fairly and reasonably, have formed the view that no disability at all occurred while the complainant was in the active service of the employer, such a view would have been completely at odds with the facts as disclosed to the tribunal and with the assumed state of facts which seemingly informed the insurer's consideration of the matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s486"">For that reason, I would regard this latter reading of the tribunal's reasons as an unlikely one.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s487"">71 The matter is made the more complex by the sentence commencing with the word 'further'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s488"">Here, the tribunal seems to refer to all the medical reports, not only those made in the first 10 months.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s489"">Based on those reports, the tribunal expresses a single opinion as to unfairness and unreasonableness which was the very matter which it had to decide under s 37 of the Complaints Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s490"">There is a question whether, by reason of that sentence, whatever previous errors of law are to be found in the tribunal's reasons should be discounted or held to be unlikely to have affected the result.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s491"">72 I return to the tribunal's statement that the correct date for assessment was six months after the date on which the complainant finished work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s492"">As a matter of construction of the policy, that was not a correct statement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s493"">It is not clear why the tribunal made it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s494"">It could have been because of a mistaken view of the operation of the definition of TPD in the policy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s495"">Alternatively, it could have followed on from the tribunal's mistaken identification of the definition of 'date of disablement' in the policy, to which I have referred in par 14 above.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s496"">Either way, it seems that the statement, taken on its own, was erroneous in point of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s497"">That being the case, the next question is whether the error might have had any consequences for the way the tribunal went about its task of considering whether the insurer's decision was unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s498"">As I have attempted to explain, an examination of the succeeding part of the tribunal's written reasons does not provide a clear answer to that question.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s499"">An important element of the reasons was that, within ten months or so after the complainant ceased working, no medical opinion provided support for the proposition that he was totally and permanently disabled.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s500"">Although other passages may tend to indicate that the tribunal took a broader view, I believe that, once having identified an error of law underlying the tribunal's determination, I should treat that error as having been of no consequence to the determination itself only in a clear case.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s501"">Manifestly, the present is not such a case.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s502"">In the circumstances, the complainant's cross appeal must be upheld.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s503"">73 As appears from par 70 above, I also think it likely that the tribunal erred in point of law by approaching the case on the basis that the policy required that the complainant have been totally and permanently disabled while in the active service of the employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s504"">Such an error is not patent, however, and it may be said that its discernment relies on too precise a dissection of the broad thrust of the tribunal's decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s505"">In the circumstances, I am not prepared to go the full distance of finding that the tribunal did err in this respect.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s506"">74 Mr Bingham challenged the decision of the tribunal on a number of other grounds, none of which, in my view, discloses an error of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s507"">First, he analysed the medical reports which were before the tribunal with a view to making good the proposition that the tribunal 'went wrong in its conclusion that there was no medical opinion supportive of the complainant being unable to work full-time at the time he ceased work and for the ten month period thereafter'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s508"">He pointed out that the complainant had been seen by his general practitioner, Dr Nelson, in 1999 and, although he did not report then, in October 2000 Dr Ridgway, who replaced Dr Nelson, reported that, in July 1999, the complainant was unable to work because of a perforated duodenal ulcer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s509"">She referred also to the Workcover certificates (based on stress) which had been issued by Dr Nelson at the outset.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s510"">She referred to various consultations which she had with the complainant in late 1999 and early 2000, and to the complainant's inability to contemplate work at his former place of employment at that time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s511"">Mr Bingham referred also to a report by Dr O'Kelly in September 2000 which referred to early consultations with the complainant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s512"">He submitted that it was erroneous for the tribunal to have relied only on those practitioners who 'reported' in the period to which it referred.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s513"">In the view I take, however, whatever justification there may be, at the general level, for Mr Bingham's criticisms of the tribunal in this respect, there is nothing amounting to an error of law in the approach which the tribunal took.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s514"">As I have indicated above, it would seem that the tribunal's reference to the practitioners who reported in 1999 and early 2000 may have been in response Dr Sale's cautionary note that the long history of medical consultations which the complainant had experienced served only to reinforce his own perceptions of his psychological indisposition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s515"">However that may be, the tribunal's emphasis on the opinions of the practitioners who reported in the early months happened to be the way it approached its task of considering the fairness and reasonableness of the insurer's decision, and was open to it as a matter of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s516"">75 Mr Bingham had a further complaint about this aspect of the tribunal's reasons.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s517"">It focussed upon the statement that the 'only requirement' in the definition was that the work be 'regular', which the tribunal understood to be a reference to the complainant 'working full-time'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s518"">Mr Bingham submitted that the definition said nothing about 'full-time' work, but rather required that the work which the complainant might putatively be able to obtain was 'regular remunerative work for which he is reasonably fitted by education, training or experience', elements to which the tribunal, in his submission, paid no attention.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s519"">I consider that Mr Bingham's criticism of the tribunal in this regard involves too fastidious, and too pedantic, a concentration upon particular words and phrases, and overlooks the context and meaning of the passage in question.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s520"">When the latter is taken into account, it will be seen that, in this passage, the tribunal was concerned to mark out a single point of distinction between the definition in the policy, and the corresponding definition in the rules of the fund.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s521"">Both definitions required the decision-maker to consider whether there was likely to be work to which the complainant was fitted to by education, training or experience, and it is manifest from other parts of the tribunal's reasons that it made its decision in accordance with that requirement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s522"">The point at which the definition in the policy departed from the definition in the rules of the fund was that the latter did not require that the work be remunerated at the same level of remuneration as the complainant was receiving at the time he worked for the employer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s523"">The definition in the policy does require that the work be remunerative, but not that the remuneration be at the same level as previously.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s524"">The tribunal was right to point out, in conjunction with its treatment of the 'remunerative' element of the work, that the only other qualifier introduced by the definition in the policy was that the work be 'regular'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s525"">I do not understand Mr Bingham to have criticised the use of the concept of full-time work as a synonym for the concept of regular work, and understandably so, since it was in his client's interests to have the definition in the policy construed in a way that would produce a putative regime of work that was rather more demanding than might be the case, for example, if 'regular' were held to encapsulate part-time work.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s526"">In the circumstances, I do not consider that this aspect of the tribunal's reasons involved an error of any kind, much less one of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s527"">76 As I understood him, Mr Bingham submitted that, separately from the matter with which I have just dealt, the tribunal was in any event in error in failing to consider, and to make explicit findings on, the question whether the putative work in which the complainant might be able to engage was work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s528"">He submitted that, in ignoring a central element of the definition in the policy, the tribunal erred in point of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s529"">As I have indicated above, however, it is manifest that the tribunal was conscious of this requirement: indeed, it referred to it in terms in the middle of the very paragraph in which it exposed its reasoning with respect to the decision of the insurer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s530"">There was no error of law involved here.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s531"">77 Finally, Mr Bingham referred to a number of respects in which, he submitted, the tribunal had misunderstood or misread the medical reports which were before it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s532"">When those reports were properly understood, he submitted, there was no evidence on which the tribunal could conclude that it was not unfair and unreasonable for the insurer to have decided that the complainant could obtain regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s533"">The result, according to Mr Bingham, was that the tribunal made a finding of fact for which there was no support, thereby erring in point of law.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s534"">He referred me to an extract from the judgment of Barwick CJ in Sinclair v Maryborough Mining Warden [1975] HCA 17 ; (1975) 132 CLR 473, 481: ""It was essential that there be material before [the warden] ... which would warrant an affirmative conclusion on the substance of the application that the recommendations should be made.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s535"">""",
"Mr Bingham referred also to the judgment of the Full Court in City Corp Life Insurance Ltd v Smith [2005] FCAFC 102 , [11]:",
" ""There is no doubt that it is an error of law for a tribunal to make a finding of fact for which there is no support.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s536"">""",
"I consider, however, not only that the context in which each of these observations was made differs from the present, but also that Barwick CJ, and their Honours in the Full Court, were referring to a state of affairs quite different from that upon which Mr Bingham relies.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s537"">In this part of his submission, Mr Bingham was not dealing with a 'no evidence' point at all: rather, he was seeking to have the court stray beyond its limited role and make findings about the validity of the factual conclusions which the tribunal drew on the basis of the medical reports before it, with a view then to inviting the court to observe that there was no medical evidence which supported the tribunal's conclusion.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s538"">Such an approach needs only to be exposed in that way for it to be obvious that it is a long way distant from the discernment of an error of law in the tribunal's decision.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s539"">It might also be said that Mr Bingham's submission in the present respect betrays an attempt to cast the tribunal in the role of an investigator of the question whether the original decision of the insurer was right or wrong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s540"">As pointed out earlier in these reasons, the tribunal has no such role.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s541"">Neither did it purport to perform a function of that kind: it confined itself to consideration of the question whether the insurer's decision was unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s542"">",
" 78 For reasons expressed earlier, however, the complainant's cross appeal will be allowed, and the relevant determination by the tribunal set aside.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s543"">",
" COSTS 79 The trustee has succeeded in part as against the complainant, and the complainant has succeeded as against the insurer.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1"">2 Further, ASIC seeks an order for the winding up of GPEL on the ground that the 'directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in any manner whatsoever that appears to be unfair or unjust to other members' (s 461(1)(e) of the Act) and on the further ground that the court is of the opinion that 'it is just and equitable that the company be wound up' (s 461(1)(k)).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s2"">3 The applicant plaintiff also seeks an order for the winding up of the second defendant, Green Pacific Energy Capital Pty Ltd ('GPEC') on the just and equitable ground.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s3"">4 On the question of insolvency, the essential contention made by ASIC is that GPEL cannot pay its debts as and when they fall due either by reference to its own cash flows or by reference to a timely realisation of assets or by recourse to secured or unsecured funding facilities which can be demonstrated to be both available to meet the obligations of GPEL as and when they fall due and made available to GPEL by entities that have a demonstrated capacity to provide the necessary funds as and when required.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s4"">5 GPEL contends that having regard to the essential character of the undertaking conducted by the company which involves the promotion and development of renewable energy power generation projects (through subsidiary entities) utilising green waste fuel to produce heat energy which can be converted into electricity through a process known as 'Fluidised Bed Combustion' ('FBC') technology and the development of a 5 megawatt (MW) pilot power plant at Staplyton in Queensland, the capital requirements of GPEL as to both debt and equity, necessarily varied according to the projects to be undertaken and, in part at least, depended upon GPEL establishing the optimised success of its pilot plant and particularly sustainable budgeted cash flows.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s5"">The contention is that once the success of the pilot plant, both in terms of the technology and economic efficiency could be established, the technology would then be deployed in conjunction with a further power generation project (13.5MW) at the Staplyton site thus generating economies of scale and positive budgeted cash flows.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s6"">The technology would also be deployed at other sites throughout Australia.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s7"">6 GPEL contends that although proving up the optimisation of the pilot plant confronted a series of particular technical difficulties thus impacting upon cash flows, GPEL was at all material times additionally supported by the foundation shareholders and entities related to GPEL by the provision of debt finance.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s8"">Moreover, having regard to relevant terms and conditions of some of those facilities, the debt was capable of being converted to equity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s9"">Those entities, it is said, continue to provide enduring financial support in terms of both debt and equity to GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s10"">Accordingly, GPEL contends that, at the date of the hearing of the application and looking forward as 'a matter of commercial reality' consistent with Lewis (Doran Constructions in (Liq)) v Doran &amp; Ors [2005] NSWCA 243 , GPEL can pay its debts as and when they fall due.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s11"">In addition, particular financial arrangements relating to the entity promoting the pilot plant, namely, Green Pacific Energy Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s12"">1 Pty Ltd ('GPES No 1') were 'project specific' without recourse to GPEL and therefore do not bear upon the solvency of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s13"">7 As to the just and equitable ground, ASIC contends that a director and chairman of GPEL, Mr Alfred Chi Wai Wong, who through companies related to him controls approximately 20% of the issued share capital of GPEL, engaged in misconduct which had the effect of prejudicing the interests of investors in and creditors of the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s14"">The foundation contention is that Mr Wong, without a resolution of the Board of Directors of GPEL, authorised the payment to entities related to him, namely, Richland Investment (Australia) Pty Limited ('Richland') and G P Energy Pty Ltd ('G P Energy') of approximately $5M in the period 19 November 2004 to 9 December 2004 out of capital ($6.3M) subscribed by J F Capital Partners Ltd ('JFCP').</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s15"">That capital, 31.5 million shares in GPEL at $0.20 per share was subscribed, ASIC contends, by JFCP on or about 18 November 2004 as a result of a presentation made to JFCP by GPEL and was contributed expressly on the footing that the subscribed capital would be utilised by GPEL to enable it to secure the attraction of debt finance from Investec Bank (Australia) Limited ('Investec') for the acquisition and construction of new plant at the Staplyton site (Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s16"">2).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s17"">8 The new site was to be the first economically efficient green power project promoted by GPEL and thus GPEL's foundation positive cash flows.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s18"">The use by Alfred Wong of the capital subscribed by JFCP to retire debt to entities related to him in the face of the representations made to JFCP is said by ASIC to demonstrate that the undertaking of GPEL 'cannot be carried on consistently with candid and straightforward dealings with the public, from whom further capital must be obtained if its existence is to be prolonged' ( Re Producer's Real Estate &amp; Finance Co Ltd [1936] VLR 235 of 246) and to reflect a willingness on the part of Alfred Wong to prefer the interests of Richland (and thus his own interests) to that of the members and creditors of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s19"">9 GPEL contends that capital subscribed by a shareholder can properly be used for the commercial purposes of GPEL and the application of the funds subscribed by JFCP to reduce debt and eliminate interest was both orthodox and prudential .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s20"">10 A second contention which is said by ASIC to lead to a conclusion that the court ought to be satisfied that it is just and equitable that GPEL be wound up is that notwithstanding a decision on the part of the Board of GPEL on 11 May 2005 to place 'a freeze' upon raising money from the public by the issue of promissory notes, Alfred Wong caused a 'Second Information Memorandum' to be developed and published pursuant to which further promissory notes were issued by GPEC and monies raised from the public without the authority of the Board of Directors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s21"">11 Alfred Wong concedes that the Board did place a freeze upon taking steps to cause GPEC to issue further promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s22"">However, in a process of introducing GPEL to the market as part of a high level 'soft' presentation of GPEL's activities and those of GPEC, a number of participants at particular presentations conducted by Mr Andris Lielkajis 'under the banner of Great Pacific Investment Services Pty Ltd' ('GPIS'), a company related to Alfred Wong, took up a 'Second Information Memorandum', completed an application form for the notes bearing a maturity date of 31 March 2007 or 30 September 2007 or two years from the issue date at an interest rate of 11.5% per annum and subscribed particular funds which were accepted by GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s23"">Alfred Wong contends that he elected not to return the monies raised through the issue of the notes on advice from Andris Lielkajis as it would have had, in his judgment, an adverse market impact upon GPEL to do so.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s24"">12 In reliance upon these contentions, ASIC seeks a winding up order on the just and equitable ground in respect of both GPEL and GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s25"">13 ASIC further contends that the application by Alfred Wong of the funds raised by the subscription from JFCP, to retire debt due to Richland in circumstances where, upon a proper construction of the terms and conditions of the facility, the debt was open to conversion to equity at the election of GPEL thus extinguishing the debt, was conduct contrary to the interests of the members of GPEL as a whole and had the effect of preferring the interests of Alfred Wong and entities related to him.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s26"">Accordingly, ASIC seeks a winding up order in reliance upon s 461(1)(e).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s27"">Alfred Wong contends that the application of the funds was orthodox and prudential and does not represent conduct in the affairs of the company on his part designed to serve his own interests rather than the interests of members as a whole.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s28"">14 A considerable body of affidavit evidence has been filed in the application.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s29"">The question of whether GPEL is at the date of the hearing insolvent is conditioned by the history of events from the date of acquisition of control of GPEL by the current shareholder group on 15 April 2003 and the various financial arrangements struck in order to enable the company to continue as a going concern.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s30"">Other questions going to the just and equitable ground and whether the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than the interests of the members as a whole involves an examination of the governance of the company and the conduct of individuals.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s140"">39 Richard Nott , a Director independent of the GPFG syndicate, contends that the continuing financial support of Richland and Alfred Wong was fundamental to the status of GPEL as a 'going concern' because Richland was a friendly foundation shareholder and therefore unlikely to act, so far as the Richland GPEL debt facility was concerned, in a way that would prejudice GPEL's 'liquidity', that is, access to needed cash flows.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s141"">The assignment of the debt to Austcorp introduced a third party unconstrained by those concerns and therefore the assignment was a material matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s142"">Moreover, Richard Nott and ASIC contend that although the assignment occurred in July 2004 , the Board was not informed of the assignment until Peter Gan advised the directors at a Board meeting, in the absence of Alfred Wong, on 15 December 2004 .</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s442"">Pierre Prentice says that Alfred Wong did not respond to the email.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s443"">Pierre Prentice deposes to these further matters: '15.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s444"">On or about 13 September 2005, I conducted a review of GPE's quarterly, half, yearly and annual financial statements for the period since the $6.3M Investment, and found out that it had been used to pay off outstanding loans owing to entities related to GPE or its officers.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s445"">I did not know that the $6.3 million Investment had been used in that manner until I read those financial statements.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s446"">",
 16.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s447"">I believe GPE's management was less than honest with JFCP for two reasons: (1) They said they would keep JFCP fully informed of the progress in implementing its expansion plans but they did not; and (2) The $6.3 Million Investment was supposed to be used by GPE to construct new plants, but instead the majority was used to repay outstanding loans owing to entities related to GPE or its officers.</sentence>",

 17.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s449"">On or around 17 October 2005, after the suspension of GPE and the failure of Alfred Wong to respond to my email concerning the failure to lodge financial statements, JFCP started to sell its shares in GPE.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s450"">At the date of this my affidavit [4 July 2006] , JFCP does not hold any shares in GPE'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s451"">",
 93 Paul Willis attended the meeting and in his affidavit filed 13 July 2006 he says that he recalls telling Alfred Wong and Peter Gan at the meeting on 15 July 2005 that JFCP would not be investing any more money in GPE.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s452"">Paul Willis says that he did not know that the JFCP subscription had been used to pay off outstanding loans to GPEL's related parties until he was so informed by Pierre Prentice arising out of Pierre Prentice's review of the quarterly, half yearly and annual financial statements.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s453"">Paul Willis says: 'I would not have recommended that JFCP subscribe for shares in GPE if I knew that a substantial amount of the $6.3 Million Injection would be used to pay outstanding loans owing to GPE's related parties' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s454"">94 As to the non-disclosure to JFCP of the use of the $6.3M, Alfred Wong at paragraph 22 of his affidavit filed 25 July 2006 says that in the half yearly information for the year ended 31 December 2004 published in February 2005 and provided to the Australian Stock Exchange, the accounts of GPEL record that current interest bearing liabilities were reduced in the six months to 31 December 2004 by approximately $3M and the repayment of borrowings in that period was approximately $3,124,000.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s455"">Alfred Wong says, 'This information was available to the public and in particular to J F Capital' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s456"">95 At paragraph 12 of the affidavit of Edgar Hung filed 5 July 2006, Edgar Hung says that when the money payable by Richland to Austcorp was ready to be remitted to Austcorp, 'Alfred Wong asked me whether Austcorp Group needed the money now or whether Richland could use the funds under the Austcorp-Richland Loan for something else in the meantime.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s457"">I told him that Richland could use the funds in the meantime, as long as the Austcorp Group was repaid before the end of the financial year ending 30 June 2005'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s458"">Edgar Hung says that on or about 30 June 2005, $1.2M was transferred to Austcorp's account with the ANZ Bank by Richland and that this was in repayment of a part of the Austcorp-Richland Loan.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s459"">On 8 December 2004, GPEL had deposited $1,482,022.35 into the account of Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s460"">Edgar Hung says that on or about 1 July 2005, $800,000 was transferred to Austcorp's account by Richland in payment of a part of the Austcorp-Richland Loan.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s461"">The general ledger of GPEL records 'a loan repayment' on 23 November 2004 of $800,000.00 which is reflected in a credit in the Richland account of the same day.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s462"">It seems likely that consistent with the request made by Alfred Wong of Edgar Hung that Richland enjoy the further use of monies Edgar Hung claimed to be otherwise owing, GPEL made the two payments on 8 December 2004 and 23 November 2004 at the direction of Alfred Wong and the monies were subsequently paid to Austcorp on 30 June 2005 and 1 July 2005 respectively by Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s463"">Edgar Hung says at paragraph 15 of his affidavit that as at 1 July 2005 the amount owed by Richland to Austcorp under the Austcorp-Richland Loan was $580,006.65.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s464"">96 It should also be noted that according to Alfred Wong's summary of the payments made to Austcorp on 23 November 2004, 8 December 2004 and 9 December 2004, the amount paid was $3,370,857.60 which is precisely the amount that was owing by GPEL to Richland at 30 June 2004 immediately before the arrangement struck with Austcorp on 1 July 2004.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s465"">That debt had been extended on 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2005 and the facility extended to $5M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s466"">Consistent with the provisions of the Term Sheet for the extension of the facility, the renewed facility did not mature until 30 June 2005 and further funds up to $5M would be available up to the maturity date.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s467"">If the facility was renewed on 30 June 2005, the facility would retain its character as a debt facility for an additional term.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s468"">If not extended, GPEL had a discretion to effect a repayment of the principal sum and all accrued interest either in cash or by issuing fully paid shares in GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s469"">97 Alfred Wong gave oral evidence in cross examination (and at paragraph 18 of his affidavit filed 25 July 2006) to the position that the assignment by Richland to Austcorp of the debt payable by GPEL to Richland preserved the identical terms of the debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s470"">Accordingly, Austcorp was not entitled to call upon GPEL for payment of the facility monies until the maturity date.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s471"">At the moment in time when GPEL made payments to Richland in respect of the assigned debt to Austcorp, or alternatively, made payments to Austcorp directly, the monies, prima facie, were not due and payable by GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s472"">It seems that the very likely construction is that GPEL made payments to Richland at Alfred Wong's direction which were retained by Richland and subsequently paid to Austcorp in accordance with the arrangement made between Alfred Wong and Edgar Hung facilitating the continued use of the 'Austcorp' monies by Richland until 30 June 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s473"">In any event, the Board of GPEL had not approved the application of the monies.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s474"">Governance of GPEL was vested in the board of directors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s475"">There is no evidence of any delegation of authority to the chairman either generally or within particular financial limitations to make payments on behalf of the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s476"">The Board of Directors was entitled to consider any demand for payment by either Richland or Austcorp, assess the merits of such a claim, take management advice in relation to the claim and reach a deliberative conclusion as to whether GPEL's monies should be applied in making the payments.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s477"">Alfred Wong foreclosed that deliberative process in favour of his own interests.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s478"">98 It is difficult to conceive of any basis upon which the members or creditors of GPEL derived any advantage in these payments or the arrangement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s479"">The advantage is said to be that GPEL was saved interest that would have been incurred upon the drawn down funds.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s480"">The interest payable under the facility was a margin of 7% above the 30 day bank bill rate (12% in all --- see [50]).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s481"">Upon repayment of the funds, Richland established a facility on 8 December 2004 and an extension of that facility on 9 December 2004 at an interest rate margin which was also 7% above the 30 day bank bill rate.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s482"">Although discharge of the earlier facility may have reduced increments of interest on the principal draw down, Richland's proposition was that it would re-establish a facility of the same size as the earlier facility and presumably if it was contemplated that significant draw downs would be quickly made, interest would be incurred on precisely the same basis.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s483"">In any event, whatever the commercial advantage of taking the particular course might have been, it was a matter for the Board to determine the question with the benefit of management advice leading to a prudential business judgment rather than a fait accompli as a result of the conduct of the chairman.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s484"">",
 Conclusions 99 The following conclusions [100] --- [113] can be drawn from all of these events.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s485"">100 It is very unlikely that Alfred Wong entered into the loan agreement with Austcorp and the assignment of the Richland GPEL debt as a function of treasury management or to introduce Austcorp as a long term participant into the affairs of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s486"">Rather, Alfred Wong borrowed the Austcorp monies at 25% interest per annum to partly repay his own debt to Apiang Woong which, upon default, was accumulating interest at the rate of 45% per annum and as a consequence of default the guarantors and grantors of security were rendered susceptible to a demand for payment of the debt and enforcement by Woong of the securities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s487"">101 The assignment of the GPEL Richland debt to Austcorp was a material matter having regard to the discussions within the Board as early as the meeting of 18 August 2004 and expressions of concern over GPEL's liquidity and the funding of working capital by Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s488"">The relationship between Richland and GPEL was a further matter of materiality having regard to the 'going concern' matters raised by BDO.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s489"">102 Richard Nott as Chairman of the Board's Audit Committee and fellow director Robert Patterson as an Audit Committee member, were present at the committee meeting on 26 August 2004 when GPEL's auditors, BDO, asked for a copy of the original loan agreement between GPEL and Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s490"">That request was made expressly in the context, as the minutes record, of the assignment to Austcorp Group Limited of the GPEL debt to Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s491"">The BDO report to the Board concerning the financial accounts to 30 June 2004 was considered by the Audit Committee on 20 September 2004 and Note 5 of the draft accounts expressly describes the assignment and the Put Option.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s492"">That note is reflected in the final accounts signed by Alfred Wong on 28 September 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s493"">103 Although Alfred Wong did not, so far as the minutes reflect, expressly inform the Board of the assignment of the debt, it is unrealistic to think that relevant knowledge of the assignment was not before the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Richard Nott and Robert Patterson as a result of the discussion on 26 August 2004 and in consequence of a consideration of and adoption by the directors of the accounts for the financial year ending 30 June 2004 containing a note of the relevant matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s494"">However, the minutes of the meeting of directors on 6 July 2005 make it clear that both Richard Nott and Robert Patterson seemed to proceed on the footing that the assignment ought not to have occurred without the express authority of the Board and that the assignment was, in any event, on the same terms and conditions of the Richland GPEL loan.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s495"">104 The discussions in the meetings of directors of GPEL from May 2004 revealed systemic difficulties in securing the optimal operation of the pilot plant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s496"">Concerns had reached a point at which the Board considered whether GPEL ought to shut down the pilot plant and 'cut its losses' in the light of the unsustainable pattern of diminished trading revenue and increased costs.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s497"">Alternatively, the pilot plant might be put on 'care and management'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s498"">The directors agitated for the urgent resolution of arrangements with Viridis to take over the pilot plant and for Viridis to participate in arrangements to acquire the second Staplyton plant upon completion of construction consistent with the Investec proposal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s499"">105 In addition, concerns had been expressed about GPEL's liquidity as early as the meeting of directors on 18 August 2004 and GPEL's dependence upon Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s500"">Richard Nott urged that arrangements with Richland be reviewed with a view to securing an extension of the facility.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s501"">BDO had expressed the reservation that GPEL and the group generally was dependent upon the ongoing financial support of GPEL's shareholders and lenders.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s502"">Richard Nott expressed further concern about GPEL's gearing ratio and the impact upon loan facilities with Investec at the meeting of directors on 27 September 2004.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s503"">The directors recognised that in addition to capital required to construct each proposed power plant, GPEL required a few million dollars as working capital.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s504"">In the context of these concerns about liquidity and working capital, Alfred Wong advised the meeting of directors on 22 September 2004 that Richland would continue to provide funds for working capital and would be prepared to convert the inter-company loan into subordinated equity to improve GPEL's gearing ratio which would also be improved with the reduction of debt by the issuing of shares in payment of a particular acquisition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s505"">106 At the Board meeting on 17 November 2004, the directors further considered the augmentation costs for the pilot plant and mechanisms for financing both the pilot plant and Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s506"">2.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s507"">The Board recognised that GPEL did not have the finance to repay the Richland loan and the solution was perceived to be the conversion of the loan to equity or the restructuring of the loan at long term debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s508"">In the context of financing Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s509"">2 the Board was advised that Jardine Fleming would take up an equity investment in GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s510"">Peter Gan discussed the preference of securing equity funding from Jardine Fleming rather than striking contracts with Investec and Viridis conditional upon the pilot plant achieving a 'steady satisfactory performance level'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s511"">107 The presentation to Jardine Fleming was made on the footing that the subscribed capital would be used to facilitate the attraction of funds from Investec to enable the second Staplyton plant to occur.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s512"">I accept the evidence of Pierre Prentice and Paul Willis as to the representations made to them.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s513"">I am satisfied that Alfred Wong understood that the presentation to JFCP was on the footing, consistent with the Patterson PowerPoint presentation that JFCP would be encouraged to subscribe capital to secure GPEL's capacity to build new power plants and, particularly, a second plant at Staplyton.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s514"">108 Although it is not clear whether Alfred Wong expressly knew of the content of the press release to the Australian Stock Exchange of 18 November 2004 stating that the funds secured from JFCP would be applied 'to the roll-out of GPE's pipeline of renewable energy projects', I am satisfied that Alfred Wong understood that the funds were to be so applied which is consistent with the final paragraph of the GPEL Stock Exchange release of 26 November 2004 which directed attention to the ' combination of strategic partners and institutional investors who have recently joined GPE, by providing the platform to lead the renewable energy market locally and globally ' [emphasis added].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s515"">Alfred Wong may not have seen the content of this release.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s516"">However, the minutes of the meeting of directors on 6 July 2005 make it clear that Alfred Wong's understanding was that the JFCP monies would be applied in support of project finance for GPEL's power projects.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s517"">109 I accept that Peter Gan's recollection is that he mentioned that some of the JFCP funds would be applied in the payment of some creditors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s518"">However, it is clear that such a statement did not convey to Pierre Prentice or Paul Willis any notion that the funds subscribed would be used for anything other than the fundamental purpose of establishing sufficient equity to enable GPEL to secure the Investec loan by placing GPEL in a position to satisfy the qualifying 'construction equity' condition.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s519"">110 It is clear that immediately upon receipt of the JFCP funds, Alfred Wong applied a substantial proportion of those monies to pay Richland and/or Austcorp in circumstances where both those companies had a particular relationship with Alfred Wong; the directors of GPEL had not met, considered or approved the making of the payments (and therefore whether, in the judgment of the Board, the payments represented a prudential decision); the payments were arguably not due as the maturity date had not 'fallen in'; and by making the payments, GPEL was deprived of the opportunity of considering whether an extension of the debt to Richland and/or Austcorp on negotiated terms (at or about the maturity date) might be achievable or, in the absence of an extension of the facility arrangement, GPEL might exercise an entitlement to convert the debt to equity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s520"">111 The use by GPEL of the JFCP subscription at the direction of Alfred Wong was expressly inconsistent with the expectations held by JFCP in reliance upon the presentation made by Peter Gan.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s521"">I am satisfied that Alfred Wong, at the moment in time when he chose to apply a significant proportion of the JFCP funds in the manner previously described, knew and understood that JFCP had subscribed for capital in GPEL not for the purpose of paying creditors whose debts were then due and payable or paying monies to entities related to Alfred Wong but rather to provide capital which would enable GPEL to take advantage of a financing proposal from Investec and thus establish a green to waste power project which would help to generate enduring positive cash flows for GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s522"">Moreover, I am satisfied that Alfred Wong knew and understood that the expectation of the Board was that the JFCP monies would be so applied.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s523"">112 In reaching these conclusions, I accept the evidence of Peter Gan and to the extent that that evidence is inconsistent with the evidence of Alfred Wong, I prefer the evidence of Peter Gan.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s524"">113 In these respects, I am satisfied the conduct of Alfred Wong is misconduct.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s525"">It seems to me that it is no answer to that conduct to say that the election to make the payments in the circumstances described above had the effect of reducing the interest burden which attached to the facilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s526"">The directors of GPEL were entitled to consider and if thought prudential, apply the subscription in a way which was in the best interests of the company, its members and creditors and in a way which was consistent with the tenor of Board discussions and representations made to JFCP.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s527"">Nor, in terms of disclosure to JFCP is it an answer to say that the accounts of GPEL to 31 December 2004 published in February 2005 adequately disclosed, to JFCP, the use of the shareholder funds.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s528"">114 On 6 July 2005 at a meeting of directors, Alfred Wong provided directors with an explanation of the 'background behind the Richland credit facility'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s529"">Alfred Wong said that it was important for the Board to understand that background.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s530"">In making that explanation Alfred Wong conceded, as the minutes reflect, that the JFCP investment of $6.3M was 'to be applied to roll-out GPE's pipeline of renewable projects.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s531"">Austcorp called for the loan to be repaid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s532"">Over the next few weeks, all of Austcorp's loan and fees, Richland's loan and fees and G P Energy's outstanding rental payments were repaid by GPE from the monies received from Jardine, leaving very little for project development' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s533"">Richard Nott and Robert Patterson expressed concern.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s534"">The minutes record: 'The Board felt that had the due process been followed, ie approval sought from the Board Audit and Risk Management Committee, the loan would not have been assigned to Austcorp especially under different terms and conditions to the original loan facility with Richland ' [emphasis added] .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s535"">The minutes further record these observations: 'When GPE repaid the Austcorp loan assigned by Richland, it was approved by Alfred which created a conflict of interest as the loan was not due and payable to Austcorp.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s536"">Richard believed that this payment should not have been authorised by Alfred due to this conflict and the consequences of changing the terms of the loan agreement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s537"">This put the company in a very difficult position as it drained a lot of liquidity from the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s538"">",
 Both Richard and Robert requested Alfred to make good the original loan facility of $5 million immediately.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s539"">Edwin should never have been asked to approve the assignment, instead the Company Secretary should have brought this to the attention of the Board Audit &amp; Risk Management Committee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s540"">' [emphasis added] 115 In the context of those remarks, Alfred Wong explained his perception of the facility Richland was providing to GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s541"">He said this: 'Alfred explained that when he provided the Richland loan to GPE it was always intended to be an evergreen facility, ie to be continually extended .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s542"">It was only in the event that the loan was not extended that the outstanding balance would be converted to equity, at GPE's discretion.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s543"">This was the spirit of the agreement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s544"">' [emphasis added] PROMISSORY NOTES 116 A further question arises in relation to the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s545"">117 In or about October or November 2004, Alfred Wong in his capacity as a director of GPEL discussed with Andris Lielkajis the possibility of GPEL issuing promissory notes to raise funds for its projects and activities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s546"">An Information Memorandum dated December 2004 was prepared pursuant to which GPEL sought to raise $10M through GPEC by way of the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s547"">Andris Lielkajis was appointed in his capacity as Managing Director of ABL to promote the issue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s548"">He did so under the banner of GPIS.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s549"">The issuer was GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s550"">The notes would bear interest at the rate of 11.5% per annum payable monthly in arrears and the maturity date for the notes fell into three categories.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s551"">First, those notes issued prior to March 2005 would mature on 31 March 2007, those notes issued between 31 March 2005 and 30 September 2005 would mature on 30 September 2007 and those notes issued after 30 September 2005 would mature two years from the issue date of the relevant notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s552"">The notes are to be repaid in full on the maturity date supported by a floating charge over all present and future assets of the issuer.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s553"">118 Ten investors subscribed for the promissory notes in GPEC pursuant to the Information Memorandum and GPEC raised $1,390,000.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s554"">119 As to the Second Information Memorandum, Andris Lielkajis by his affidavit filed 20 July 2006 says as follows: '9.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s555"">In or about June 2005 I was advised by Alfred Wong that the Board GPE wanted to put the issuing of GPEC Promissory Notes on hold pending the updating of the content of the Information Memorandum.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s556"">I had advised Alfred Wong that it is potentially damaging to the share price of GPE to launch a product and then suddenly withdraw, closing all further communications and marketing.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s557"">From this point of perception, we deemed it better to turn the promotional program for the Promissory Notes into a ""soft one"", which involved promoting GPE, the company and its activities, for future recognition and possible investment, coupled with education as to the nature of Promissory Notes as a vehicle available to the public and the risk return of mezzanine finance as a whole.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s558"">",
 10.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s559"">In or about late August or September 2005, Alfred Wong advised me that the Second Information Memorandum (the ""August 2005 Information Memorandum"") was completed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s560"">I was undertaking some seminars and presentations in relation to financial products and I had a need to use an example of those presentations.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s561"">I agreed with Alfred Wong that the August 2005 Information Memorandum would be used by me as an example of this type of product in these presentations.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s595"">123 Alfred Wong accepts that in the months of April and May 2005 concerns were expressed by Board members about the issuing of promissory notes having regard to the recognition that the pilot plant was proving to be more expensive to operate than anticipated and was affecting GPEL's capacity to undertake other projects.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s596"">Alfred Wong accepts that he was at a special meeting of the Board at GPEL on 11 May 2005 when the directors resolved that there would be a 'freeze' on raising any more money by the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s597"">Alfred Wong says in his affidavit filed 19 July 2006 that it was 'in any event necessary to review the First Information Memorandum to ensure its currency before any further promissory note offers were put to the market' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s598"">As a result, the Second Information Memorandum was developed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s599"">On 19 August 2005, Lielkajis conducted in Brisbane the first of the seminars at which the Second Information Memorandum was available for collection by potential subscribers.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s600"">The proposal to distribute the Second Information Memorandum was not put to a meeting of directors to determine whether the circumstances that led the Board to place a freeze on 11 May 2005 on raising money from the public by promissory notes had been resolved to the satisfaction of the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s601"">Nor was a proposal put to the Board that GPEL ought to formulate a Second Information Memorandum and distribute the Memorandum at a series of presentations in the public arena by way of an understated or 'soft' marketing of a GPEL product namely, a new class of promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s602"">124 The circumstances that led the Board to place a freeze on the issue of promissory notes included these matters.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s603"">At the Board meeting on 11 May 2005, Peter Gan presented a Capital Management Plan for the period May to August 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s604"">Initially, $1M would be drawn down under the Richland facility which would be used to pay TechComm $400,000 and trade creditors $500,000 (other than related parties).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s605"">Peter Gan recommended that $413,000 of related party claims be converted to equity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s606"">The monthly 'cash burn rate' would be approximately $275,000 until August 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s607"">The plan put to the directors was to 'progressively pay off the payables using the funds received from the promissory notes, Cornell Capital and also the Richland credit facility whenever there is a shortfall' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s608"">The minutes of the meeting record the concerns expressed by Richard Nott, in these terms: 'Richard was concerned that the Information Memorandum on the promissory notes, state that the promissory notes were being issued for the purpose of financing capital projects but instead were being used to fund the operating expenses of the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s609"">Also from a Trade Practices Act point of view, it should be clearly spelt out especially since it looks unlikely that the Company would be able to repay the debt in two years time when they all mature.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s610"">This is tantamount to Misleading and Deceptive Conduct because we are just rearranging the debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s611"">' 125 In addition, the minutes report observations by Robert Patterson in these terms: 'Robert too stressed how uncomfortable he was with taking monies from those subscribing to the promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s612"">The management's presentation is a complete sea change in direction and until the company's strategy is crystallised, GPE shouldn't be borrowing any more money from outsiders other than Richland as Richland is an informed lender.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s613"">' 126 Peter Gan outlined the elements of the Capital Management Plan and suggested that the feasibility of particular projects ought to be further evaluated in 30 days.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s614"">127 The minutes record that: 'Robert again stressed that he was concerned and is very disappointed that up until now, there have been all these strategies floating around and yet no decision has been made to date and in his opinion, 30 days is too long especially if we are still planning to borrow from promissory note subscribers and Richland.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s615"">This is unacceptable when we do not know which direction the company is heading'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s616"">",
" 128 In relation to the promissory notes, the minutes of the meeting record Richard Nott's observations in these terms: 'Richard also recommended that the promissory note Information Memorandum and Term Sheet should also be carefully reviewed by a wider group of professionals such as lawyers and auditors before being endorsed by the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s617"">In response to the questions raised over the Richland loan, Alfred informed the Board that the loan has a fixed and floating charge over GPE's assets and is only ranked behind the loan facility from Investec Bank.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s618"">However, Richard's concern was that the funds raised through the promissory notes were being used to retire the Richland loan instead of being used for capital projects.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s619"">Alfred summed up the decisions made thus far: a freeze on borrowing any more money from promissory notes until there is a firm decision on the company's strategy.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s620"">The promissory note Information Memorandum and Term Sheet is to be reviewed by lawyers and auditors before being endorsed by the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s621"">' 129 At the meeting of directors on 8 June 2005, the question of the promissory notes was further considered.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s622"">The minutes of the meeting record these remarks: 'All monies from promissory notes had been frozen until the Board had approved the company's strategies.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s623"">Richard again stressed the importance of being completely open and transparent about the use of the promissory note monies in the Information Memorandum.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s624"">The document must state up front that the funds will be used to retire debt as well as part of a seed program.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s625"">Peter had used the Information Memorandum prepared by Baker &amp; McKenzie for another related party company as a sample for GPE's Information Memorandum.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s626"">Peter will amend the document to reflect the changes recommended by Richard and circulate it around the rest of the Board members for approval.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s627"">' 130 On 15 June 2005, the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Board met.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s628"">The question of the promissory notes was further discussed and the minutes record these matters: ' (e) Promissory Notes Richard explained that there was a conflict of interest with the issue of promissory notes, because the company through which the promissory notes were distributed is a related company of Alfred Wong's, the Chair of the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s629"">The use of the funds was also not adequately disclosed in the Information Memorandum.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s630"">Peter has since received legal advice and a final version of the Information Memorandum is now available for review.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s631"">",
 Richard requested a policy be drawn up that states that any debt raisings have to be approved by the Board and must comply with the Company policy on authorisation levels and approvals before any trade debt or structured debt can be retired.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s632"">The approval process should not be after the transaction has taken place and the Board having to ratify the transaction as a result.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s633"">A policy for approving trade debt already exists and Alex suggested that Heymala draft another policy on Related Party Debt for review at the next Board meeting.</sentence>",

 ' 131 At the meeting of directors on 6 July 2005 the question of the promissory notes was noted again in these terms: ' 6.</sentence>,

"<sentence id=""s636"">' 132 On 24 August 2005, Richard Nott became aware of the Second Information Memorandum and became very concerned about it.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s637"">133 On 24 August 2005, Richard Nott sent a memorandum to the directors of GPEL in these terms: ' PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL TO :The Board Of Directors CC :Edwin Yeung, Secretary Heymala Eardly, Secretary FROM :Richard Nott SUBJECT :RAISING DEBT --- PROMISSORY NOTE ISSUE ENCLOSURE :GREEN PACIFIC ENERGY CAPITAL LIMITED NOTE ISSUANCE SUMMARY At two recent Board meetings it was agreed that GPE would cease raising loan funds via Promissory Notes as the invitation schedule to investors had not been approved by the board, nor the quantum of borrowing.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s644"">",
 I have a problem in supporting this proposal on a number of issues: 1.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s645"">The board stated clearly that issues of promissory notes were to cease and any proposal for new raisings was to be approved by the board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s646"">This has not happened and in my view would not be supported by the board for combinations of the following issues.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s647"">",
 2.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s648"">The board has not seen or approved a Capital Management Plan which shows how the raising of $30M if achieved will be utilised and how the debt burden of $3-4M pa will be provided beyond further borrowing.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s649"">It appears that a Staplyton construct or Rocky Point tender payment/reconstruction will be in that figure worth around $40M on completion or potentially higher for Rocky Point.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s650"">I do not believe that an undefined parcel of notes, potentially to $30M can be repaid in 2 years or the debt serviced from income.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s655"">a dollar lent may be immediately backed by only 60 cents asset value.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s656"">If funds are lent to an investment vehicle GPEL, which has existing investors, it becomes then a composite investment in GPEL and the asset shortfall is spread amongst a larger pool of investors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s657"">Investors are not told about this.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s661"">",
 5.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s662"">The offering says that some of the funds may be used to retire debt.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s669"">",
 7.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s670"">I do not believe that GPEL can construct a plant over say a 2 year period funded entirely by debt as upon completion it will not generate enough revenue to service the debt cost let alone repay the principal.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s671"">I believe that an optimum debt load per plant would be $20M, with $10M of equity to realistically attract lenders or debt providers with some asset coverage and the company with an ability to service borrowing.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s672"">Added to this is the significant large NTA [Net Tangible Asset] reduction of corporate assets from a revaluation by the audit review.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s673"">I think a raising of $30M is flawed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s674"">",
 8.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s675"">The raising does not state what the position is if only say $5M is raised and therefore a plant cannot be constructed due to lack of equity/subordinated debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s676"">Will investors get repaid?</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s677"">There must be some reasonable degree of evidence that the raising will achieve its stated purpose.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s681"">If the Rocky Point tender is one, there is a potential basis to go forward and upon which to raise equity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s682"">However, as the majority of shares are tightly held, it may not be possible for the minority shareholders to potentially take up to say $10M of equity raisings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s683"">To raise debt without any firm program or intention to repay lenders in the event that an insufficient debt component is raised to complete a project is not commercially supportable (ie.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s686"">The other sites indicated as attractive and ready for construction is incorrect as well.</sentence>",

 Richard Nott Director.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s693"">' 134 On 25 August 2005, Richard Nott resigned from GPEL's Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s694"">Alfred Wong at paragraph 87 of his affidavit filed 19 July 2006 says that he did not have an opportunity to explain the circumstances of the preparation of the Second Information Memorandum to Richard Nott prior to his resignation.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s695"">Moreover, Alfred Wong says at paragraph 87 of his affidavit that nor had he had an opportunity to put the revised Information Memorandum to the directors of GPEL for endorsement before Richard Nott's resignation.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s696"">I am not willing to accept the evidence of Alfred Wong on these matters.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s697"">Alfred Wong knew and understood that Richard Nott held strong views about the importance of GPEL not engaging in any conduct involving placing a promissory note issue into the market.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s698"">Similarly, Robert Patterson had expressed concern about the same matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s699"">The Board was entitled to consider serious questions of the kind raised by Richard Nott in his memorandum (raised as soon as he became aware of the development) and plainly enough, had Alfred Wong made enquiries of Richard Nott, Richard Nott would undoubtedly have articulated the concerns reflected in his note of 24 August 2005 consistent with earlier views articulated at the Board meetings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s700"">It seems to me that the conduct of Alfred Wong deprived the Board of an opportunity to further consider whether a soft market launch of a promissory note issue ought to occur and the content of the document GPEL might, if at all, put into the market.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s701"">135 By paragraphs 88 and 89 of his affidavit filed 19 July 2006, Alfred Wong says this: '88.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s702"">When the form of the Second Information Memorandum was finalised in late August 2005, I raised with William Lamont and Danny Au-Yeung, the possibility of a ""soft"" launch of the product to test and orient the market with this product.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s703"">They agreed that such a test was warranted.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s704"">",
 89.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s705"">As a result of this I spoke with Mr Andris Lielkajis, Managing Director of ABL Global Limited and raised with him the possibility of putting the Information Memorandum out into the public arena by way of ""soft marketing"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s706"">This involved circulating the Second Information Memorandum without intending that any promissory notes would be issued.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s707"">The purpose of circulating the Second Information Memorandum was to keep the product in the market and to assess any interest in the market.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s708"">I made it clear to Mr Lielkajis that GPE and GPEC did not yet intend to issue further promissory notes as GPE had to address management issues and had to get its projects back on track.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s709"">' 136 It is clear from the minutes of the Board meeting, the minutes of the Audit Committee meeting and the memorandum from Richard Nott that the board of directors of GPEL had not approved the Second Information Memorandum and had not approved any process by which the Second Information Memorandum might be put into the public arena.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s710"">The first presentation had occurred on 19 August 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s711"">Alfred Wong at paragraph 88 of his affidavit filed 19 July 2006 says that he 'raised the possibility' of a soft launch of the proposed promissory notes with William Lamont and director Danny Au-Yeung.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s712"">Alfred Wong does not say that either of these gentlemen approved the Second Information Memorandum or agreed with Alfred Wong that a 'soft' launch of the promissory note product should be made.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s713"">In any event, the discussions with William Lamont and Danny Au-Yeung did not constitute a resolution of the board of directors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s714"">The election by Alfred Wong to put the promissory note Information Memorandum into the market by Andris Lielkajis through entities related to Alfred Wong and Lielkajis was misconduct particularly having regard to the criticisms made by Board members of a promissory note issue by GPEL and GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s715"">Whether the criticism of the Information Memorandum was well made or not, the directors of GPEL had not considered the matter further and had not resolved to proceed with any form of promissory note issue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s716"">137 Section 461(1) of the Act empowers the Court to make an order for the winding up of a company on enumerated grounds including that the Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound up (s 461(1)(k)) and on the ground that directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of members as a whole or in any other manner whatsoever that appears to be unfair or unjust to other members.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s717"">Section 462(2) of the Act confers standing on ASIC to apply for an order to wind up a company on a ground provided for by s 461, in the circumstances contemplated by s 464.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s718"">Section 464 provides that where ASIC is investigating or has investigated for the purposes of Division 1 of Part 3 of the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ('the ASIC Act') matters connected with the affairs of a company, ASIC may apply for a winding up order.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s719"">ASIC contends that as a matter of public interest with a view to protecting the investing public whose funds have been solicited by way of the JFCP subscription and conduct in relation to the promissory notes, it is just and equitable that GPEL and GPEC be wound up as, upon a proper examination of the conduct of both companies, the Court ought to be satisfied of 'a justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and management of the affairs' of each company ( Loch v John Blackwood Ltd [1924] AC 783 at 788 per Lord Shaw).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s720"">138 Although the usual applicant for an order on such a ground is a contributory , it is clear that ASIC has standing to apply for an order on the just and equitable ground in the pursuit of public interest and the Court will examine those public interest considerations to determine where the actual public interest lies ( Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Limited ( ASC v A S Nominees ) (1995 --- 1996) 62 FCR 504 at 531C, per Finn J).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s721"">See also Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd 41 ACSR 561 per Davies AJ at [95]-[97]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v ABC Fund Managers &amp; Ors 39 ACSR 443 at [116]---[129], per Warren J; and Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd &amp; Ors 36 ACSR 778 at [75] per Owen J.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s722"">139 In this respect, the ground has 'a proper role to serve as an instrument of investor protection' ASC v A S Nominees at 531 and one expression of that protection is whether the affairs of the company can be carried on 'consistently with candid and straightforward dealing with the public, from whom further capital must be obtained if its existence is to be prolonged' ( Re Producers' Real Estate &amp; Finance Co Ltd (1936) VLR 235 at 246 per Mann CJ).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s723"">Another is whether creditors or members can continue to have confidence in the conduct of the affairs of the company ( Re Chemical Plastics Ltd [1951] VLR 136 at 142 per Hudson A-J; ASC v A S Nominees Ltd at 531).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s724"">Where the order is sought by a Regulator such as ASIC in vindication of the public interest, the Court must itself evaluate the factual matrix in order to form a view as to whether 'a sufficient reason' for making the order is demonstrated ( Re Walter L Jacob &amp; Co Ltd (1988) 5 BCC 244 at 251).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s725"">In other words, what is the quality of the conduct or the burden of the misconduct.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s726"">Accordingly, I have examined in some considerable detail the background circumstances concerning the subscription of the JFCP funds and their use; the events surrounding the prohibition by the Board upon the issue of any further promissory notes and the circumstances which led Alfred Wong and Andris Lielkajis to arrange for presentations of the GPEL product at various seminars by Lielkajis.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s727"">I have found that the conduct in relation to those matters is misconduct for all the reasons indicated previously.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s728"">I will not repeat them here.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s729"">However, the assessment of that conduct and the conclusions I have reached concerning it reflects a lack of confidence in Alfred Wong and the directors in the conduct and management of GPEL and GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s730"">140 I am satisfied that the quality of the misconduct in relation to the JFCP subscription is significant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s731"">The governance of GPEL is ultimately undertaken by means of a deliberative process on the part of the Board in determining where the interests of the company, its members and creditors lie.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s732"">The expression of that deliberative process in relation to the question of whether Austcorp or Richland was entitled to be paid any monies in the period 19 November 2004 to 9 December 2004 and whether funds subscribed by JFCP could properly be applied in the payment of such claims (if made) consistent with the presentation to JFCP was a matter to be determined by the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s733"">In assessing that matter, the Board would no doubt have had regard to the relationship between GPEL and Richland, the question of whether such payments (if due to Richland) might be the subject of conversion to equity, the effect upon the liquidity and solvency of GPEL and whether, consistent with the proper discharge of the duties of directors, the JFCP funds could be applied in the manner that Alfred Wong might have proposed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s734"">141 In fact, the Board was deprived of any deliberative process on these questions as Alfred Wong caused the monies to be paid to a company he controlled in order to accommodate demands which were then made, in effect, beneficially upon him, by reason of claims made upon Richland as trustee of a trust the beneficiary of which was Alfred Wong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s735"">The conduct of causing JFCP to subscribe for capital in the company on the assumption previously described and then immediately use that money to discharge debts contended by Alfred Wong to be payable to a company related to him was both improper and misleading of JFCP.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s736"">Such conduct is the expression of the character of the misconduct as Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Aust Timber Pty Ltd (1999) 17 ACLC 893 per Merkel J, demonstrates.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s737"">142 I take the same view in relation to the conduct concerning the release into the marketplace (by reason of the conduct of Alfred Wong and Lielkajis) of the Second Information Memorandum concerning the promissory notes to be issued by GPEC.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s738"">That conduct occurred in circumstances where the Board had placed a prohibition upon GPEL seeking to raise funds through promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s739"">GPEL's wholly owned subsidiary GPEC became an issuer of promissory notes pursuant to the Second Information Memorandum.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s740"">The deliberative processes of the Board in making an informed judgment as to whether GPEL through its subsidiary was in a position to raise money from the public with confidence that such money could be repaid and in circumstances where the Board could be confident that the Information Memorandum reflected a full, accurate and truthful description of the circumstances of GPEL, its business undertaking and its prospective activity, were foreclosed .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s741"">The minutes of meetings of the directors and the memorandum by Richard Nott reflect the strength of feeling in relation to issues central to a decision as to whether GPEL ought to raise money from the public through GPEC or otherwise by means of promissory notes.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s742"">143 Public interest in the governance of corporations and particularly corporations listed on the Australian Stock Exchange demands engagement by the Board in material questions which affect or are likely to affect the affairs of the company and the interests of the members and creditors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s743"">In this case, the Board had expressed a strong view that further issues of promissory notes, in the context of the company's liquidity, its relationship with lenders and general capital adequacy considerations (quite apart from going concern issues), must not occur.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s744"">The question of whether that prohibition might continue to operate was not taken to the Board.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s745"">Explanations by Alfred Wong of a 'soft launch' or a general high level introduction to the market of GPEL provides no compelling explanation for depriving the Board of the opportunity to engage in the affairs of GPEL and GPEC on such a material matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s746"">144 I am satisfied that a winding up order ought be made in respect of both companies pursuant to s 461(1)(k) of the Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s747"">I am also satisfied that in respect of the use of the JFCP funds by Alfred Wong and the foreclosure of the deliberative processes of the Board in assessing the matters I have described, Alfred Wong acted in the affairs of the company in his own interests rather than in the interests of members as a whole and in a manner that was unjust or unfair to other members including JFCP because the funds were immediately deployed to reduce debt to a related entity rather than the deployment of the funds as 'construction equity' to attract the Investec facility.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s748"">Accordingly, an order ought to be made that GPEL be wound up pursuant to s 461(1)(e).</sentence>",

" EVENTS POST 31 DECEMBER 2004 145 On 23 February 2005, the Audit Committee met.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s755"">146 The report was procured as part of a capital management study for GPEL against the background of four matters then under consideration by GPEL, namely; whether the pilot plant should be put on a program of care and maintenance due to the 'quite severe operational problems with the Staplyton 5MW plant' ; whether GPEL ought to sign an EPC agreement for a proposed plant without having secured debt and equity financing for the plant; whether GPEL ought to utilise a promissory note funding program; and, whether GPEL ought to raise further equity funds to construct the Morwell plant then under consideration and later abandoned.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s756"">The author of the report observed that placing the 5MW plant on care and maintenance might involve an 'event of default' under the Investec facility in terms of a material change in circumstance.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s759"">As to the intended equity raising, the author observed that: 'Further capital injections are subject to the market's confidence in GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s760"">In my opinion that confidence is rapidly being eroded for a number of reasons namely: ... it was stated in an ASX release on 18 November 2004 that the $6.3m capital raising at that time was to be used for the roll-out of the projects in GPE's pipeline and in fact these funds were used to retire debt to Richland.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s762"">' 147 The author of the report observed that GPEL appeared to have the 'ability to meet its obligations over the next year as and when they fell due as GPEL had the Richland loan ($2M facility drawn to $460,000 at the end of February 2005) and Promissory Note facility ($10M facility drawn to $450,000 at the end of February 2005) to draw upon.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s763"">However, GPEL's ability to service those facilities relies completely on its ability to raise further equity capital.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s765"">148 At the meeting of directors on 4 April 2005, the Board considered a recommendation to sell the pilot plant to Viridis as one mechanism for solving the continuing issues surrounding the pilot plant and further considered the financial position of GPEL going forward.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s910"">I also asked if the company had confirmation from Investec that the loan breaches would have no impact and that the funding going forward was still available.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s911"">He said that the offer was still there from previous.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s912"">I said that it had been agreed by Alfred at the Audit Committee that he would be able to get these confirmations and subsequently they have not told us otherwise.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s922"">That day, Edwin Yeung responded.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s923"">The issues involved questions concerning the accounts payable; a comparison of the financial results as formulated with the preliminary results reported to the Stock Exchange; the foreshadowed operating result of a net loss after income tax of $13,615,601.00; the proposed 'impairment loss' in relation to the pilot plant; and other matters.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s924"">On 28 September 2005, Ian Fergusson sent an email to Edwin Yeung concerning the draft annual report, in these terms: 'There are many aspects of the Report we are concerned about and this is necessarily slowing down the process.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s930"">Further exchanges took place between Tobutt and Yeung on 29 September 2005 particularly in relation to clarification of whether Investec was content to take no action in relation to the matter Peter Gan had disclosed to BDO during the course of an audit visit namely, 'that the debt service covenants of the loan [Investec] had been breached' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s931"">Edwin Yeung advised that Investec had not asserted a breach based upon a failure to comply with the debt service covenants.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s933"">On 29 September 2005, Edwin Yeung further advised that no issue had been taken by Investec concerning the matter of the covenants in relation to the debt service ratios.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s934"">On 30 September 2005, Edwin Yeung pressed BDO for a statement in relation to the going concern nature of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s935"">Tobutt responded advising that because of the sensitivity of the accounts both GPEL and BDO needed to be satisfied that all issues have been resolved.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s936"">On 30 September 2005, Edwin Yeung responded to BDO's proposed going concern statement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s937"">Edwin Yeung sought to incorporate in the qualification BDO proposed to make on the topic of whether GPEL was a going concern a comment at point 35 to this effect: 'We have received a commitment from the major shareholder (Richland) that funds of $5m will be made available to the company.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s940"">As to the Staplyton pilot 5MW plant, BDO said this: 'GPEL has determined the carrying value of its Staplyton 5MW plant to be $2,865,212.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s941"">The 5MW plant is currently operating at a loss and will not be able to generate positive cash flows unless it is operated in tandem with another plant such as the proposed Staplyton 13.5MW plant project.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s942"">In our opinion, the carrying amount is in excess of the assets recoverable amount and therefore GPEL has not applied the requirements of AASB1010.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s943"">In our opinion, the Staplyton 5MW plant should be written down to its scrap value or $0 and therefore $2,865,212 (or such lesser amount) be written off as an expense to the Statement of Financial Performance.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s944"">Had this been done, the operating loss before income tax would increase to $16,480,813 and Total equity reduced to $428,925.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s945"">' 178 BDO further qualified the report in relation to the Staplyton 13.5MW plant, other projects of GPEL and the intangible assets.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s946"">BDO expressed the opinion that the financial report of GPEL was not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 as the accounts did not give a true and fair view of the company's financial position as at 30 June 2005 nor of GPEL's performance for the financial year ended on that date.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s947"">Nor did the accounts comply with Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s948"">The independent audit report contained this statement: '... Inherent Uncertainty Regarding Continuation as a Going Concern Without further qualification to the opinion expressed above, attention is drawn to the following matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s949"">Note 1A of the financial report details the directors' opinion on the company's ability to continue as a going concern.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s950"">In our opinion, the ongoing viability of the company is dependent upon its securing sufficient further equity as well as loan funds to enable it to successfully develop new green energy plant facilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s951"">In the event that the company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it is likely to be required to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the normal course of business and at amounts different from those current stated in the financial report.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s952"">' 179 On 7 October 2005, Alfred Wong on behalf of GPEL provided BDO with a letter setting out a wide range of comments in relation to the matters which had been the subject of inquiry by BDO and, in particular, comments in relation to asset valuations of property, buildings, plant and equipment and intellectual property, comments in relation to the liabilities of GPEL, its contingent liabilities, events subsequent to balance date and remarks in relation to the opinion of GPEL that the financial statements should be prepared on the basis that GPEL is a going concern.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s953"">As to that matter, Alfred Wong's letter contained these observations: '... Going Concern 32.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s954"">We believe that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s965"">The minutes of the meeting note Alfred Wong's observation concerning his ' disappointment with BDO for delaying the completion of the audit resulting in GPE being suspended from trade since 3 rd October 2005' [emphasis added].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s966"">The directors adopted the Annual Report.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s967"">The minutes also note that 'Alfred also explained [to directors] that since the Board made a decision not to issue any more promissory notes until there is a firm strategy in place, $50,000 had already been receipted.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s968"">The advice given was not to return the monies received because this may be viewed negatively by the market.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s969"">The product should be pulled out of the market slowly.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s970"">Alfred asked the Board to ratify the decision to accept the monies received to date'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s971"">The Board did so.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s972"">The action items attached to the minutes note that a review was to be undertaken, assigned to Alfred Wong, to 'review Richland credit facility loan documentation for Board endorsement (A resolution is to be put forward before the shareholders to approve the credit facility with fixed and floating charge over the company's assets)' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s973"">181 At the meeting of directors on 26 October 2005 Alfred Wong reported that GPEL required capital of approximately $16M to purchase plant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s974"">The minutes note that Alfred Wong's expectation was that GPEL would probably be able to raise about $10M from Investec by way of debt and the balance of $6M would need to be subscribed as capital.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s975"">Alfred Wong suggested that strategic partners might be sought for a rights issue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s976"">182 On 28 October 2005, BDO submitted its final report to GPEL's Board noting that: 'The Board should be aware that the comments made by management have not been substantiated or validated by us' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s977"">As to the Richland $5M facility, BDO noted that the loan agreement had not been properly executed as the provision of security by GPEL had to be approved by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s978"">The final report noted that: 'The lender has allowed periodic drawdowns of the facility to fund GPE's working capital requirement.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s979"">At the date of this report (which is for the period ending 30 June 2005) total funds drawn are close to $2.2 million leaving a further $2.8 million available for future usage.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s980"">The company has received no commitment that the loan will not be demanded for repayment within the next 12 months'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s981"">183 Counsel for the defendants put to Ian Fergusson that BDO had failed to have regard to or take account of the various matters put to BDO by Alfred Wong in the letter of 7 October 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s982"">Ian Fergusson rejected that criticism on the basis that although some of the things contained in the letter had been put to BDO previously, the proposition simply represented management statements rather than an attempt to come to grips with the request by BDO to provide independently verifiable audit evidence to support statements by management.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s983"">I accept the evidence of Ian Fergusson generally.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s984"">184 On 31 October 2005, BDO forwarded a letter of resignation as auditors to Alfred Wong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s985"">The covering letter enclosed BDO's final fee account with an explanation of the basis for the fee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s986"">In cross examination, counsel for GPEL and GPEC put the proposition to Ian Fergusson that the question of discontent and non-payment of professional fees was the real source of discontent and the reason for the resignation by BDO as auditors.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s987"">Although plainly enough this was an issue, I am satisfied that the dominant cause of the resignation was BDO's discontent with responses by GPEL and GPEC to continuous requests for proper audit evidence to enable BDO to form an opinion about matters central to the completion of the financial accounts and the independent view BDO needed to form on matters of particular importance to the members and creditors of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s988"">On these matters, I accept the evidence of Ian Fergusson.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s989"">185 In the course of the hearing, I asked Ian Fergusson to explain the reasons why, on behalf of BDO, he resigned the position as GPEL's auditor.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s990"">He responded: 'I think predominantly, it would have been because I came to the conclusion that not only did we have a difference of opinion on key aspects of matters pertaining to the company that probably would never be resolved but I was also concerned that information that was vital to be able to do a thorough audit was very hard to get from the board, which made carrying out an audit for us very time consuming and very difficult.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s991"">And then there comes the financial side of things, where we seem to be in perpetual conflict on what a reasonable fee would be, given the circumstances, and where you don't get paid your fees, you do sometimes get into a situation where you think you have a --- your independence gets impaired.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s992"">So a whole number of reasons, but it all adds up to the fact that I thought that BDO should part company with GPE.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s993"">' Ian Fergusson acknowledged that although not all of BDO's professional fees had been paid in respect of the audit work, GPEL disputed aspects of the matter.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1003"">188 In cross examination, counsel for GPEL and GPEC put to Mark Schneider that in Schneider's commercial experience, although the default was not insignificant: '... it's not the sort of thing that is unknown, is it?</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1070"">The Osmond Kwok facility is to be repaid in full on 10 October 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1071"">No part of the ABCL facility has been drawn down.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1072"">The clauses providing for an extension of the term in each agreement do not expressly identify the extended date although, as a matter of construction, the parties presumably intended that the facility would be extended for a new term of the same period as the old term.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1073"">In any event, the effect of the extension will be simply to postpone the date when the debt pursuant to each facility must be paid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1074"">It may be that the term of the facility will again be extended and in that sense, Richland, might proceed on the footing that the facility 'evergreen'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1075"">If the only consequence of extending the term is to postpone the date on which the debt becomes due and payable with no obvious mechanism by which cashflows will be available to GPEL to pay the debt or the rescheduled debt pursuant to each facility and no assets are available that might be realised in an orderly fashion to meet obligations when they fall due, the conclusion is open that GPEL, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, is unable to pay its debts as they fall due.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1076"">It should be noted that the extension of each Richland facility is expressly predicated upon the submission to Richland of a statutory declaration signed by a director that GPEL will be insolvent if repayment of the debt is effected at the repayment date.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1097"">Robert Elliott concludes that if the agreement of Richland, Alfred Wong, Osmond Kwok and Danny Au-Yeung to convert each of the amounts due to them to ordinary shares in GPEL at one cent is not approved by the shareholders, there is a potential solvency issue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1098"">Robert Elliott contends that GPEL has, in any event, the opportunity to obtain an extension of the Termination Date beyond 30 September 2006 and 10 October 2006 and because the extension is automatic if supported by the relevant declaration as to insolvency in the event of payment, those debts will not become due and payable and thus GPEL is not insolvent.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1099"">Robert Elliott contends that the non-automatic extension in respect of the Osmond Kwok agreement would mean that replacement funds would be required in the event that the approval of shareholders for the issue of shares in GPEL is not obtained.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1100"">Robert Elliott contends that on the assumption that the amounts paid to Richland, Kwok and Au-Yeung are converted to shares or, alternatively, the amount payable to Richland is extended and the debt payable to Kwok on 10 October 2006 is not 'called up' by him, GPEL will have a cash surplus of $3,363,300 after meeting operating expenses for the 12 months from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 estimated to be less than $800,000.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1101"">206 This postulated result may be a little odd in terms of demonstrating the solvency of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1102"">The cashflow statement for the 12 months to 30 June 2007 does not demonstrate any revenue from operating activities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1103"">There are none and thus no revenue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1104"">207 There is no evidence that the conditions precedent to the attraction of the Investec loan are likely to be satisfied nor that the Altona power plant has been installed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1105"">The cash surplus of $3,363,300 is predicated upon draw downs of $250,000 each month for 12 months from ABCL, draw downs of $65,830.00 for the months of July, August, September, October, November and December of 2006 and January 2007 from Richland, and draw downs for the months of February, March, April, May and June of 2007 of $112,520.00 from Osmond Kwok.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1106"">These financing cash-in flows amount to $4,023,430.00 and after meeting operating expenses and other outgoings there is a surplus of cash at 30 June 2007 of $3.36M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1107"">In that sense, GPEL's accumulating cash position by draw downs might well result in a cash surplus but that result is entirely dependant upon draw downs from ABCL, Richland and Kwok.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1108"">Since there are no operational activities generating cash flows in the financial year, it is difficult to see how the obligation of GPEL to repay the further amounts drawn down under the financial facilities will be met even assuming the current draw downs are either converted to equity or, alternatively, extended or not pressed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1109"">This is not that class of case where an external or related third party financier is providing interim financial support pending the sale of a major asset.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1110"">208 The answer is said to be that all amounts drawn down under the Richland and Kwok facilities ($7,671,571 in all) and all further cash flow draw downs to 30 June 2007 projected by Robert Elliott to be $460,830.00 from Richland and $562,600.00 from Kwok, will be converted to equity if the shareholders approve.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1111"">If not, Richland recognises the automatic extension entitlement in GPEL and, in any event, Richland will not call up the debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1112"">Osmond Kwok has agreed to convert his debt to issued shares in GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1113"">Osmond Kwok is silent on his attitude to recovery of the debt in the event that the shareholders fail to pass the relevant resolution.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1114"">Accordingly, the non-current loans by Richland and Kwok when they become current on 30 September 2006 and 10 October 2006 will, it is said, be converted to equity or converted to non-current loans or, in the case of Richland, if the loan (together with further draw downs) remains current, it will not be pressed or claimed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1115"">209 In that sense, the balance sheet position of GPEL must be adjusted, it is said, to take account of the realities, in a commercial sense, of that evidence.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1116"">210 Robert Elliott has assessed a pro forma balance sheet as at 30 June 2006 submitted to him by GPEL and has considered those adjustments that need to be made to reflect a true and accurate position particularly in relation to the current assets and current liabilities of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1117"">In assessing that balance sheet and the adjustments made to it, the carrying value of property plant and equipment has been written down to a minimum realisable value of $2.5M and the carrying value of intangible assets at $4.47M has been written down to zero.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1118"">Total assets, current and non-current, are $2.97M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1119"">Of the current assets, trade and other receivables were written down from $287,921.00 to $178,455.00 and then further adjusted to $96,116.00 once Robert Elliott examined GPEL's primary documents relating to business activity statement returns and thus the likely refund to GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1120"">Cash and cash equivalents in the current assets amount to $290,299.42.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1121"">211 As to current liabilities, the pro forma balance sheet suggests that trade and other payables amount to $1,865,817 but Richard Elliott believes that the amount should be adjusted by $976,155.00 in respect of payables to related entities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1122"">These amounts are to all be converted into equity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1123"">They are these: Accrued Interest payable to Richland $477,505.00 Amounts payable to related entities for shared expenses $49,301.00 Directors' fees payable to Alfred Wong and Danny Au-Yeung $221,111.00 Rent payable to G P Energy for Staplyton site $115,587.00 Rent payable to G P Energy for Morwell site $112,642.00 Total $976,155.00",
"An amount of $207,636.00 included in the payables item represents interest accrued on the loan facility provided by Investec which has been assigned to BMI and, it is said, assumed by BMI.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1124"">Similarly, the payables item includes $9,460.00 incurred by GPES No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1125"">1 and that debt has been assumed by BMI.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1126"">The adjustment is $1,193,251 resulting in a current liability for trade and other payables of $672,566.00.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1127"">The other significant current liability is in respect of short term borrowings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1128"">That amount of $3,154,455 is represented by the loan facility repayable to Investec which has been assumed by BMI.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1129"">The entire amount has been adjusted out of the balance sheet.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1130"">Current liabilities are said therefore to be $720,815.00 and current assets are $391,879.00.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1131"">",
" 212 In Robert Elliott's initial report of 19 July 2006 which was then the subject of a supplementary report correcting errors in the earlier report and, in turn, the subject of oral evidence of further corrections, Robert Elliott concluded that having regard to the adjustments I have mentioned and the assumptions previously discussed concerning the conversion of the relevant loan facilities to equity or the extension or non-enforcement of the relevant debts, the adjusted pro forma balance sheet at 30 June 2006 reflects a net asset position of $726,341.00.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1132"">By reason of the further adjustments concerning the trade and other receivables from $178,455.00 to $96,116.00 and some minor additional matters, Robert Elliott concludes that the adjusted consolidated balance sheet demonstrates total net equity of $644,002.00.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1133"">213 Although Alfred Wong deposes to the conversion of monies owing under the Richland facilities to shares or alternatively the election not to press for recovery of the debt (assuming no extension), it seems to me that the evidence is not clear that those commitments extend to rent payable to G P Energy or amounts in respect of shared expenses.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1134"">214 As to the working capital requirements for a period from July 2006 to 30 June 2007, Robert Elliott said this at page 6 of Schedule E to the material annexed to his affidavit filed 20 July 2006: 'GPE has also restructured its management team since the resignation of the previous MD resulting in a much lesser salary expense of around $38k per month as compared with $91k per month previously.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1135"">GPE will not take on any other operation in the near future other than the construction of the 13.5MW power plant as the stage 2 project at Staplyton.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1136"">However, the construction will not start until the facility from FPCFM is available in which case all the construction cost will be covered by this facility.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1137"">",
" Under the current operation mode and taking into account other incidental operating costs and interest payable on promissory notes, the total monthly operating cost of the group should be around $80k per month (in terms of cash flow) giving a total of $960k for the next 12 months.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1138"">' 215 The mechanism to be relied upon to fund those projected capital requirements includes draw downs upon the ABCL facility of $3M, recourse to Richland and Kwok and the proposed issue of further shares in GPEL to raise $418,359.00 in share capital.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1139"">216 On the question of the basis for his view as to solvency, Robert Elliott said in answer to counsel for the plaintiff: 'Look I believe the company is solvent because it has the capacity to meet its obligations as and when they fall due' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1140"">Counsel for the plaintiff put this proposition: Q: 'And you believe that, don't you, because of the unsecured loans that you think are available to the company?</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1141"">' ... A: ' Yes ' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1142"">Edwin Yeung also accepted in cross examination by counsel for the plaintiff that GPEL's ability to draw upon the loans is 'essential to GPE's solvency' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1143"">217 Robert Elliott was also asked to explain the cash flow test for solvency and apply the quick ratio test to determine the ratio in the case of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1144"">In applying the quick ratio test, Robert Elliott identified that the ratio as 0.54.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1145"">218 On the state of the present evidence, Robert Elliott accepts that the question of whether GPEL is, at the date of the hearing, having regard to all relevant circumstances, in a position to pay its debts as and when they fall due, is to be determined on the footing that GPEL has demonstrated access to sufficient cash flow by reason of unsecured loans which are both certain and available to GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1146"">All projected working capital requirements can be met through draw downs upon the Richland, Kwok or ABCL facilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1147"">If the ABCL facility is disregarded for the moment, the projected working capital requirements can be funded by draw downs upon the balance of both the Richland and Kwok facilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1148"">219 However, in order to be satisfied that GPEL is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due having regard to the commercial reality of the circumstances which have confronted GPEL for some time, it seems to me that it would be necessary to conclude that the two facilities are available, calls for draw downs upon the facilities will be satisfied and that GPEL is otherwise in a position to establish a basis upon which there is a serious prospect that it will establish operational cash flows to enable it repay debt and to service proposed infrastructure investment facilities sought by GPEL so as to establish an underlying commercial activity for the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1149"">It seems to me it is artificial to perpetually or in an 'evergreen' way extend debt facilities (or continually convert existing and future debt to issued shares) in circumstances where a company which began its operations under the existing shareholder group on 15 April 2003 has failed to establish a single operating plant (other than a pilot plant exhibiting serious technical difficulties and negative cash flows) which is generating any cash flow derived from what is said to be core operations.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1150"">GPEL is entirely dependent upon external related lenders.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1151"">220 Although it is important to have regard to the evidence of a commitment by Richland and Kwok to convert all of their debt to equity, GPEL's solvency should first be assessed on the present state of its financial capacity to pay debts as and when they fall due conditioned by its relationship with related or unrelated funders.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1152"">Richland has not yet in fact converted any of its substantial debt to equity although questions of capital adequacy have been under discussion in the affairs of GPEL for a long time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1153"">Plainly enough, GPEL has been under-capitalised in terms of its equity base and has only been able to sustain its operations by access to debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1154"">On 6 July 2005, Alfred Wong regarded that debt as evergreen (ie.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1155"">not, in his view at that time, the likely subject of equity conversion) [115].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1156"">On 4 April 2005, Alfred Wong said that GPEL should stand on its own feet and not keep relying on him for funding [148].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1157"">On 20 April 2005, directors of GPEL pressed Alfred Wong to refund the money paid to Richland from 19 November 2004 to 9 December 2004; and on 7 October 2005 when responding to BDO's proposed qualification of the accounts to 30 June 2005 on the topic of 'going concern', Alfred Wong, although confirming that funds of up to $5M were available to the company from Richland, noted that Richland had made 'no commitment that the loan would not be demanded for repayment within the next 12 months' [179].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1158"">Osmond Kwok in establishing his facility with GPEL did so on terms that the extension of the facility beyond 10 October 2006 was not automatic and Osmond Kwok expressly reserved a right to decline any extension of the facility.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1159"">The amount due under these facilities on 30 September 2006 and 10 October 2006 will be at least $7,671,570.88 (subject to further interest).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1160"">221 Although the Board minutes evidence expressions of view by directors that the Richland debt ought to be converted to equity (or on one occasion a view that the debt should be restructured as long term debt) and the minutes reflect a statement of willingness on the part of Alfred Wong to convert Richland's debt to equity, no part of the debt has been converted to equity nor any step taken to implement that position.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1161"">The sworn commitment or promise by Alfred Wong to now convert all of Richland's debt soon to be current (together with further draw downs postulated by Robert Elliott and other debts due outside the facilities to Richland such as rent) to equity arises only in the context of the ASIC proceedings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1162"">Similarly, Alfred Wong's brother-in-law, Osmond Kwok, has adopted a position that he too will convert debt owed to him (together with further draw downs under the facility) to equity, in the face of the ASIC proceedings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1163"">Robert Elliott has made assumptions that these events will occur and on the footing of those present assumptions, he concludes GPEL is solvent.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1164"">222 For my part, I am not prepared to rely upon these promises since Richland, in particular, has had many opportunities to convert debt payable to it both current and non-current to equity in the context of lengthy discussions about solvency and capital adequacy over a long period of time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1165"">In considering whether GPEL has discharged the onus of demonstrating that it is not insolvent, it is important to have regard to all of the circumstances and in that context, it should be remembered that concerns have been expressed about the solvency of GPEL and whether it might properly be considered a 'going concern' almost from the very moment that the GPFG Group secured control of Envirostar.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1166"">223 In particular, this question has been alive to Alfred Wong and Richland from June 2003 and a question of real concern to the Board and GPEL's external auditors for some time.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1167"">The issues of solvency, cash flow demands, the financial constraints confronting GPEL and conversion of Richland's debt to equity (against the background of the operational and financial problems associated with the pilot plant) were discussed at a directors meeting on 20 May 2004 [42]; a directors meeting on 21 July 2004 [43]; a directors meeting on 18 August 2004 (especially budget projections of expenditures and Richard Nott's concern over the company's liquidity) [44]; a meeting of the Board's Audit Committee on 20 September 2004 [46]; in BDO's report to the Board concerning the accounts to 30 June 2004 (observing 'the inherent uncertainty regarding continuation as a going concern') [47]---[49]; BDO's notes to the 30 June 2004 accounts and particularly Note 1 [50]; a directors meeting on 22 September 2004 addressing operating cash flows, the need for a definitive plan to resolve GPEL's capital issues and conversion of Richland debt to equity [51]---[54]; a directors meeting on 17 November 2004 (addressing financing options, the need to secure construction equity to attract the Investec funding and the need, in terms of debt relief, to convert the Richland debt to equity as GPEL 'does not have the finance to repay the loan' [58]---[60]; a directors meeting on 15 December 2004 involving an extensive discussion of all of these matters [62]-[64]; the attraction of JFCP funds and immediate use of the subscription by Alfred Wong to retire debt to Richland, G P Energy and Austcorp [68]---[115]; the election by Alfred Wong in conjunction with Lielkajis to proceed with placing a GPEL/GPEC promissory note product in the market without Board approval [117]---[136]; the BDO (Ian Fergusson) advice to the Audit Committee on 23 February 2005 that the issue of 'going concern' for GPEL would need to be monitored 'very closely by management and the Board' [145]; the Expansion Capital Report directed expressly to the 'solvency concern' [145]; the directors meeting on 20 April 2005 concerning management's presentation with 'the main focus on stabilising the company's capital position and ensuring that it was a going concern' and issues concerning the Board's view that Richland should replace the loans [149]---[151]; Peter Gan's report of 6 June 2005 concerning strategic options arising out of the problems concerning the pilot plant [154]; the extensive exchanges between BDO and GPEL between 4 August 2005 and the ultimate qualification of the accounts for the financial year ending 30 June 2005 [160]-[182]; the particular concerns expressed by BDO as to corporate governance and solvency [170]; and the failure to establish an operational power plant by meeting the construction equity arrangements and other conditions of the Investec offer which had been the subject of a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1168"">224 As to the future prospects of operational revenue, the defendants rely upon the affidavits of William Keith Lamont, Eduard Avila Alcordo and Garry Paul Ridout filed on 20 July 2006, 19 July 2006 and 31 July 2006 respectively.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1169"">225 William Lamont is an Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1170"">He is also an electrical engineer with considerable experience in power engineering and fluidised bed combustion systems ('FBCS technology'), boiler design and coal gasification.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1171"">William Lamont has been employed by GPEL since May 2002 (then Envirostar) as the General Manager for Engineering and Construction.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1172"">He remained the General Manager until 16 September 2005 and in that role he has been responsible for much of the technical work and particularly the installation and commissioning of the Stage 1 pilot power plant at Staplyton.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1173"">William Lamont was appointed Chief Operating Officer in August 2005 and appointed a director of GPEL on 16 September 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1174"">William Lamont says that the purpose of constructing the pilot power plant at Staplyton was to test and prove the efficacy of fuel and ash handling systems in a plant utilising FBCS technology.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1175"">William Lamont observes that the pilot plant was commissioned on 23 March 2004 and was 'not without its problems'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1176"">However, the primary purpose of the pilot plant was to test and perfect designs especially for fuel handling and ash handling.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1177"">He observes that the small output capacity of the pilot plant made it sub-economic because it suffered from adverse economies of scale and problems of access to quality waste.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1178"">226 William Lamont says that the Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1179"">2 project for a 13.5MW electrical power plant has been designed so as not to suffer from the same technical problems exhibited in the pilot plant and because the plant has much greater output of megawatt power as a function of its cost base, it enjoys greater economies of scale and greater efficiency.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1180"">Moreover, an in-principle agreement with BMI exists for waste collection of quality fuel.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1181"">William Lamont says that the current ASIC investigation and these proceedings has meant that the project to develop the 13.5MW Stage 2 plant has been placed on hold.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1182"">Further, William Lamont says that the proceedings have also, in his judgment, been responsible for GPEL being deprived of funding through an Australian Federal Government Scheme called the LETDF Scheme which is designed to promote clean coal technology.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1183"">In addition, William Lamont says that GPEL was moving confidently towards involvement in the design and construction of a coal gasification plant at Dalian in China and that this project has been 'put on hold' because of the present ASIC investigations and proceedings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1184"">227 The position, of course, is that the minutes of meetings of the Audit Committee, minutes of meetings of directors and exchanges between GPEL and Investec concerning the pilot plant and the terms and conditions upon which project funds might be made available taken in conjunction with the difficult capital raising issues confronting GPEL particularly having regard to the ongoing reservations on the part of BDO, has not meant that these projects have been put on hold or lost to GPEL because of ASIC's investigation or these proceedings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1185"">Rather, the systemic difficulties confronting GPEL in its capital funding (debt and equity), governance, management, preparation and implementation of budgets and operational plans, concerns regarding GPEL's capacity to provide proper audit information to its external chartered accountants to enable an informed opinion to be reached, the use of the JFCP subscription and other matters, have all been inherent in the inability of GPEL to establish an operational plant.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1186"">Moreover, the problems confronting GPEL in establishing an operational pilot plant were sufficiently significant that the solutions canvassed by directors included closing the plant entirely, placing it on care and maintenance or, as ultimately occurred, selling the plant to a third party.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1187"">Similarly, the material demonstrates that the Dalian project has not been pursued for reasons unrelated to these proceedings.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1188"">228 William Lamont says that the Staplyton No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1189"">2 project is commercially and technically viable and he has prepared a report identifying the basis for that conclusion.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1228"">235 A further proposition put by the plaintiff is that even though it is open to conclude that Richland, Kwok and ABCL are willing to continue to provide financial support to GPEL, the defendants have not established that those entities have the capacity to provide funds when called upon to do so.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1229"">236 The particular criticism is put in this way.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1230"">237 While Richland has made significant loans in the past to GPEL, that, of itself, does no more than give rise to a basis for inferring that it might do so in the future.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1231"">The defendants tendered the financial accounts for the Richland Property Trust as evidence of the capacity of Richland to continue to provide financial support.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1232"">Alfred Wong gave evidence that Edwin Yeung, GPEL's internal accountant, had prepared those accounts based upon information that: '... out of the system when we were requested by ASIC to get access to that information' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1233"">The accounts are not audited accounts.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1235"">When asked again about the accounts he further confirmed that he had not seen the accounts before.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1236"">238 The plaintiff says that the financial accounts for Richland in its trustee capacity fall well short of a persuasive demonstration of Richland's substance in that the accounts are unaudited; no explanation has been given by GPEL of the failure to produce audited accounts particularly in circumstances where Alfred Wong controls the trustee of the Richland Trust; and, finally, the balance sheet of 31 March 2006 for the trust cannot be regarded as a reliable or accurate statement of the assets and liabilities of the trust because: (i) the balance sheet includes an asset at a value of $101,100.00 when the asset will not be available for realisation within 12 months;",
 (ii) the balance sheet includes a variety of negative assets and liabilities;,
" (iii) an item identified as 'trade creditors' of $666,000.00 described in the balance sheet as a current liability has not been updated since December 2005; and (iv) the balance sheet includes as an asset, a loan of $3,653,359.89 payable to Richland by a company described as Richfield Development PL and that company was deregistered in January 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1237"">",
 239 Alfred Wong was asked why the balance sheet as at March 2006 incorporated an asset being a debt to Richland from a company deregistered in January 2006.</sentence>,
"<sentence id=""s1238"">Alfred Wong said that the obligation would be assumed by other entities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1239"">240 At page 209 of the Transcript, Alfred Wong was asked a number of questions concerning the service upon him of a bankruptcy notice by Bridgecorp Finance Limited.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1240"">Alfred Wong accepted that the debt to Bridgecorp was a judgment debt obtained in the Supreme Court in New South Wales in circumstances where the debt was not defended.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1241"">When asked why the debt was not defended, Alfred Wong responded: 'When it's a genuine obligation, you do not defend.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1242"">We --- I mean, initially, we defend the apparent hearing obligation of myself, because we think that their interest, all the things, the calculations were wrong, grossly overstated.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1243"">Later on they changed the claim to just on the principal, so, therefore we do not defend' .</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1244"">Alfred Wong agreed that the judgment debt was approximately $1.2M concerning an obligation under a guarantee.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1245"">241 Alfred Wong also agreed that he and Danny Au-Yeung are both defendants in a proceeding in the Equity Division of the New South Wales Supreme Court (No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1246"">50023 of 2005) commenced by Greentown Bellambi Pty Ltd ('GBPL') and Greentown Real Estate Group Co. Ltd ('GREG') concerning claims made by the plaintiffs pursuant to guarantees signed by the defendants in the action.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1247"">The claim is for an amount of Chinese RMB 50,059,946 against both defendants which Alfred Wong says is approximately A$8M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1248"">There is a separate claim against Alfred Wong for A$3,746,707M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1249"">Alfred Wong says that he is defending the proceedings and the question in issue is whether the guarantee is a valid guarantee or not.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1250"">242 As to the other financiers, the plaintiff says that Dr Osmond Kwok is Alfred Wong's brother-in-law and there is no reason to believe that Osmond Kwok's financial capacity could not have been demonstrated on the evidence with a statement of assets and liabilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1251"">The accounts of the Richland Property Trust show an asset described as 'Loan --- James Kwok $862,707.79'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1252"">243 As to ABCL, that company is registered in the British Virgin Isles and is controlled by Nels Tong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1253"">Alfred Wong gave evidence that he has no interest in ABCL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1254"">Nels Tong was one of the original investors represented by the GPFG Group when arrangements were made with the administrators of Envirostar.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1255"">The financial accounts for the Richland Property Trust show an asset described as 'Loan --- Nels Tong Loan A/C - $986,822.82'.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1256"">The basis upon which ABCL is said to have a demonstrated capacity to provide financial support of $3M to GPEL is that one of the company's subsidiaries, GPHI, is owed a debt of $7.3M on 30 September 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1257"">No financial accounts have been put in evidence concerning ABCL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1258"">244 As to ABCL, I am not willing to rely upon the evidence of the loan facility with that company as a basis for concluding that ABCL is in a position to support an apparent commitment to provide loan funds of $3M.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1259"">There is no credible evidence of that company's capacity to provide draw downs upon the facility.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1260"">No accounts, either audited or unaudited, have been put in evidence.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1261"">Moreover, having regard to the participation by Nels Tong in the GPFG syndicate and the apparent relationship between Richland and Nels Tong reflected in the loan facility in the accounts of the Richland Property Trust, I am not satisfied that there is a demonstrated basis for relying upon that facility in assessing the solvency of GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1262"">245 Moreover, I accept that having regard to the judgment debt obtained by Bridgecorp Finance Limited; the further claim reflected in the New South Wales Supreme Court proceedings; the circumstance that GPEL failed to comply with the statutory demand served upon it by TechComm; the acceptance by Alfred Wong that at the time that the JFCP funds were received, GPEL 'owed a considerable amount of money to numerous creditors' (82 in all --- [84]); and the recognition that to the extent that creditors' payments have been delayed, the delay was not a function of an inability of Richland to provide funds but rather 'delayed payment of creditors' was a function of implementing 'tight cash flow policies' so as to reduce borrowings:- in other words, the policy of GPEL has been to delay paying debts as and when they are due as a cash flow management policy [89] --- a serious question arises as to whether further funds will be available under the facilities.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1263"">246 I accept that Richland has demonstrated a willingness to advance funds to GPEL and historically has done so.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1264"">However, once satisfied that there is a serious question of the capacity of Richland to provide the further advances, it seems to me that the onus has not been discharged by GPEL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1265"">However, even if it can do so, it seems to me that the fundamental question is whether the advances themselves can be repaid.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1266"">Further, I examine the question of GPEL's solvency on the basis that I am not willing to infer or accept that all debt including future debt if advanced by Richland and Osmond Kwok will be converted to equity including the particular additional debts due to Richland such as rental payments [211].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1267"">In addition, the current proposal is that GPEL will enter into a new relationship with an infrastructure funder in respect of a $22M commitment in terms of a facilities management lease involving substantial future commitments to a third party.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1268"">In the absence of a statement of assets and liabilities on the part of Osmond Kwok and audited accounts on behalf of the Richland Property Trust, I am not satisfied that there is a demonstrated capacity to provide the proposed advances to GPEL through access to these facilities and accordingly, I am not satisfied that at the date of the hearing looking forward but also having regard to the history of GPEL's financial condition, it can pay its debts as and when they fall due.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1269"">247 The circumstances surrounding the claim made by TechComm are also important.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1270"">On 26 August 2005, TechComm served a statutory demand upon both GPEL and GPES No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1271"">1 demanding payment from both entities of an amount of $960,857.57.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1272"">On 15 September 2005, GPEL made an application to the Supreme Court of New South Wales under s 459G of the Act to set aside the statutory demand.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1273"">On 29 May 2006, Associate Justice MacGready determined that application and ordered that the statutory demand be varied pursuant to s 459H(4) by reducing the amount of the demand to $881,817.34.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1274"">His Honour also declared the demand to have had effect as varied, as from the date of service upon GPEL, namely, 26 August 2005.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1275"">No order was made for an extension of time to comply with the varied statutory demand.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1276"">On 29 May 2006, TechComm's lawyers wrote to GPEL's lawyers demanding payment of the varied amount by 10.00am on Wednesday, 7 June 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1277"">The date for compliance with the demand expired on 6 June 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1278"">By that date, TechComm had not received payment of the varied amount or any part of it (that is, the undisputed part).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1279"">248 On 13 June 2006, TechComm entered into a Deed of Assignment with Richland and GPEL by which TechComm assigned its right, title and interest in an Agreement which had given rise to the claim for the debt, and the debt itself, to Richland for the sum of $660,000.00 (including GST) in full and final settlement of all claims TechComm might have against either GPEL or GPES No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1280"">1.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1281"">On 19 June 2006, GPEL gave notice to the Australian Stock Exchange of the resolution of the matter; notice that Richland would release GPES No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1282"">1 from any liability in respect of the assigned debt; Richland would fund the payment of the purchase price or assignment sum through an $1.2M loan facility granted to GPEL on 10 April 2006; and Richland would convert the amount equal to that purchase price into shares in GPEL at one cent per share, subject to shareholder approval.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1283"">In an affidavit filed 26 June 2006, Germaine Mei Lin Kee deposes to a conversation with the Managing Director of TechComm, David Whan, on information and belief, that the compromise had been reached with TechComm and TechComm had accepted the assignment sum from a third party in satisfaction of GPEL's obligation.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1284"">Alfred Wong in his further affidavit filed 31 July 2006 deposes to the circumstances surrounding discussions with David Whan to resolve the matter.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1285"">Alfred Wong says that he was unaware that if the time for compliance with a statutory demand was to be extended, an application had to be filed under the Act pursuant to s 459F(2)(a)(i) as a result of which the time for compliance elapsed.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1286"">In any event, Alfred Wong says that GPEL was investigating, with its lawyers, whether grounds of appeal existed in respect of his Honour's orders and whether an application for leave to appeal ought to be made.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1287"">249 Nevertheless, the position remains that a demand was made which resulted in a variation to the demand by application by GPEL and GPES No.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1288"">1 to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to reduce the demand to $881,817.34.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1289"">Whatever the measure or extent of that further dispute GPEL might have had with the reduced amount, no part, even the undisputed part of the debt, was paid by GPEL or Richland consequent upon his Honour's variation until the total compromise amount was paid as part of an assignment of the debt.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1290"">GPEL commercially held TechComm out of the undisputed part of the debt until TechComm comprised the entire claim.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1291"">250 One further matter should be mentioned in relation to the evidence relied upon by GPEL concerning the events generally.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1292"">An affidavit by Danny Kam Yun Au-Yeung who became a director of GPEL on 15 April 2003 was filed and relied upon.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1293"">Danny Au-Yeung deals with the topics which are addressed by Alfred Wong and adopts the position adopted by Alfred Wong.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1294"">In cross examination, Danny Au-Yeung accepted that he had had the benefit of reading Alfred Wong's affidavit material and throughout his affidavit he extensively refers to paragraphs of Alfred Wong's primary affidavit sworn 18 July 2006 and filed on 19 July 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1295"">Although it is understandable that Mr Au-Yeung might have had regard to events and circumstances which would assist his independent recollection of events, I accept that Alfred Wong's affidavit and other material has very substantially influenced the formulation of Danny Au-Yeung's views, his recollection of events and his evidence.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1296"">Accordingly, I do not rely upon the affidavit as probative of any fact in issue.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1297"">Mr Bain QC made it clear in his submissions that Danny Au-Yeung's affidavit was prepared and read in the application simply so as to avoid any adverse Jones v Dunkel inference.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1298"">251 ASIC has applied pursuant to s 459P for an order that GPEL be wound up in insolvency pursuant to s 459A of the Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1299"">GPEL seeks to rebut for the purposes of s 459C(3) the presumption arising pursuant to s 459C(2) by reason of GPEL's failure to comply with TechComm's statutory demand.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1300"">Robert Elliott contends that GPEL is solvent because it can pay its debts as and when they fall due because it has access to unsecured funds from Richland, Kwok and ABCL.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1301"">I propose to disregard recourse to funds promised by ABCL in determining whether GPEL is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due, for the reasons indicated at [244].</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1302"">In addition, having regard to the matters mentioned at [223], I am not prepared to conclude that promises now made by Richland and Kwok that all funds payable to each of them will be converted to equity is a basis for a valid assumption made by Robert Elliott in determining whether GPEL is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due, looking forward.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1303"">Substantial non-current debts will become current debts on 30 September 2006 and 10 October 2006 although it may be that those debts will be rendered non-current by reason of an extension of the term of the facility on the assumption that the shareholders' resolution to convert the debt to equity is either not passed or not sought.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1304"">It seems to me in those circumstances that GPEL is necessarily insolvent having regard to all the circumstances confronting GPEL reflected in these reasons including those matters identified at [223] and a demonstrated failure to establish a plant generating sustainable operational positive cash flows.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1305"">252 It is, of course, commercially realistic to have regard to access to funds from third parties or related parties and there is 'no compelling reason to exclude from consideration [such] funds' ( Lewis v Doran 54 ACSR 410 at [109] per Giles JA with whom Hodgson and McColl JJA agreed).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1306"">That observation, however, is conditioned by the qualification that 'provided of course that the borrowing is on deferred payment terms or otherwise such that the lender itself is not a creditor whose debt can not be repaid as and when it becomes due and payable' ( Lewis v Doran at [109]) and further at [109]: 'It comes down to a question of fact, in which the key concept is ability to pay the company's debts as and when they become due and payable '.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1307"">253 Although in Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670, Barwick CJ recognised that funds that could be gained from the use of the company's assets either by realisation by sale or by mortgage or pledge of those assets within a reasonably short period of time relative to the debts in question, represent resources available to the company which might be deployed in paying debts as and when they fell due (and thus a factual matter aiding in the determination of solvency), the circumstances confronting GPEL do not involve the realisation of assets within a short period of time as, apart from the uninstalled Altona plant, there are no realisable assets and no asset which might be the subject of a charge which might convert, subject to redemption, the asset into cash.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1308"">254 Putting to one side the conversion to equity contention, the debt facilities provided by (and proposed further facilities by Kwok and Richland) are substantial and relatively short term.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1309"">If those debts are rendered non-current at 30 September 2006 and 10 October 2006 by extension for another term they will, within a period of 12 months at the latest, fall due for repayment or further extension or conversion, in the ordinary course.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1310"">The circumstances of GPEL do not fall into that class of case where a banker to the group might provide funds to meet a shortfall until, for example, completion of the sale of a major asset such as a 'shopping centre' ( Re Adnot Pty Ltd (1982) 7 ACLR 212).</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1311"">The continued extension or suspension of the currency of accumulating debt which might in the immediacy of the date for payment be postponed to a later date does not suggest solvency if there are no actual operating revenues on the horizon or assets that might actually be realised to meet the automatic deferral.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1312"">Such arrangements simply have the effect of postponing 'the evil day' for payment in an environment where there are no demonstrated revenues and no realisable assets.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1313"">255 On the question of the discharge of the evidential burden, the Court must be presented, unless otherwise explained, with the 'fullest and best' evidence of the financial position of the lenders: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACSR 609.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1314"">Clearly, 'unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1315"">Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared' ( Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 per Weinberg J relied upon by Santow JA in Expile v Jabbs Excavations (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) 45 ACSR 711 at 719.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1316"">256 If the solvency of GPEL ultimately relies upon access to financial facilities from Kwok and Richland (and ABCL), as Robert Elliott contends consistent with the views of Edwin Yeung, it is essential in the context of all of the circumstances GPEL has confronted and continues to confront described at [223] and in these reasons generally that persuasive and compelling evidence be adduced of the capacity of the lenders to provide continuing support.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1317"">I am satisfied there is a serious question that the lenders do not have that capacity.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1318"">In addition, the capacity of GPEL to retire that debt and future debt not only drawn down from those lenders but obligations established to meet new liabilities such as those arising under a facilities management infrastructure lease of the kind described by Eduard Alcordo, is not demonstrated.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1319"">257 In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that GPEL has discharged the onus of proving that it is not insolvent.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1320"">I propose to make an order pursuant to s 459A of the Act that GPEL be wound up in insolvency.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s1321"">258 Five objections have been made to sentences contained in paragraphs 18, 24, 28, 31 and 39 of the affidavit of Heymala Eardley filed on 5 July 2006.</sentence>",

"<sentence id=""s1"">In the present reasons, words and expressions have the same meanings as they had in the earlier reasons for judgment, where the background facts are set out.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s2"">2 The two Scheme Meetings were held on 15 August 2006.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s3"">Affidavit evidence shows that the orders of 5 July 2006 relating to notifications and advertisements for the meetings have been complied with.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s4"">The Scheme Creditors at each meeting agreed to the relevant Scheme by the required majority.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s5"">3 A question was raised at the NRG Victory meeting whether Ross Littlewood was able to administer the NRG Victory Scheme, given his position as a director of NRG Victory.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s6"">Mr Littlewood is one of three directors of NRG Victory.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s7"">He is also the Australian agent of NRG London for the purposes of s 118 of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) and describes himself as the ""principal director"" of Littlewoods Services Pty Ltd, which has provided ""various administrative services"" to NRG London since 1974 and to NRG Victory since 1994.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s8"">He states that those services included ""representation, technical accounting, claims settlement, cash processing and statutory record keeping and accounting"".</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s9"">4 Subsection 411(7) of the Act provides as follows: ""(7) Except with the leave of the Court, a person must not be appointed to administer, and must not administer, a compromise or arrangement approved under this Act between a body and its creditors or any class of them or between a body and its members or any class of them, whether by the terms of that compromise or arrangement or pursuant to a power given by the terms of a compromise or arrangement, if the person: (a) is a mortgagee of any property of the body; or (b) is an auditor of the body; or (ba) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of the body; or (c) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate that is a mortgagee of property of the body; or (d) is not a registered liquidator; or (e) is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate related to the body; or (f) unless ASIC directs in writing that this paragraph does not apply in relation to the person in relation to the body--has at any time within the last 12 months been an officer or promoter of the body or of a related body corporate.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s10"">"" This subsection refers to appointments or administrations after a scheme has been approved by the Court.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s11"">However, Mr Owens, counsel for the plaintiffs, while contending that the role played by Mr Littlewood as a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme, asks that, if I should take a different view, leave be granted to Mr Littlewood to administer that scheme.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s12"">5 I agree with Mr Owens that the mere fact that Mr Littlewood will continue to be, and will act as, a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s13"">6 The notion of what it means to administer a compromise or arrangement for the purposes of subs 411(7) is not defined in the Act.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s14"">In the present case, the general administrator of the NRG Victory Scheme is NRG Victory itself.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s15"">Mr Littlewood is only one of three directors of that company even though his knowledge and his role in the past no doubt signify that he is, and will continue to be, a key person in terms of the day-to-day administration of the company.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s16"">There is, however, nothing to suggest that his co-directors act at his behest or that directorial decisions are not taken by the three directors",
"7 While I do not give an advisory opinion (even the granting of leave would not protect Mr Littlewood if he should step outside the terms of the leave granted), in deciding whether to approve the Schemes I have come to the view that Mr Littlewood's mere status as one of three directors of NRG Victory, coupled with the fact that his company, Littlewoods Services Pty Ltd, may continue to provide administrative services to that company, do not, without more, indicate that Mr Littlewood will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s17"">8 There may be a question whether Mark Moyes and Scott Collings will be administering certain aspects of the Schemes, and, therefore, to the extent necessary, I will grant them leave to do so, even though they are not registered liquidators.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s18"">9 Both Schemes should be approved.</sentence>",
"<sentence id=""s19"">I make orders 1 to 5 of short minutes of order initialled by me, dated today and placed with the papers.</sentence>",
