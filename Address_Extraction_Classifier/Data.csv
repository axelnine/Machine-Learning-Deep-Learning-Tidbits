"<sentence id=""s477"">Sullivan equally was invoked by Hayne J and Callinan J to the same end in Tame .",Statement
"<sentence id=""s478"">In its apparent endorsement of Hill at [57] in the above quotation, Sullivan along with Hill and D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid above, have been treated by the New South Wales Court of Appeal as recognising that there is ""an area in which it has been held that the public law duties of police are not consonant with recognition of a private law duty of care in favour of a particular member of the public"": Thompson v Vincent at [153]-[154].",Statement
"<sentence id=""s479"">Again, as I have already noted, Tame and its debt to Sullivan and Hill were relied upon again by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Cran v State of New South Wales in privileging the greater public interested accorded unimpeded police investigation over the interest of a person suffering foreseeable harm as a result of an allegedly careless omission in the conduct of an investigation.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s480"">105 In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s481"">Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s482"">And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s483"">Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn).",Statement
"<sentence id=""s484"">106 Did the Myer-Patching communications, as I am assuming them to be, give such a different complexion to the relationship of AFP officers with Scott Rush and/or with the other applicants as to establish an arguable case that a duty such as is proposed by the applicants was owed to him or to them?",Statement
"<sentence id=""s485"">In my view they did not.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s486"">107 First, it needs to be emphasised that the AFP was performing a statutorily mandated function, i.e.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s487"">the provision of legal services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s488"">The particular subject of the inquiry --- transnational crime and illicit drug trafficking - fell within areas of ""special emphasis"" in the direction given to the Commissioner by the Minister on 31 August 2004.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s489"">As the 8 April 2004 letter to the INP reveals, the AFP was already possessed of a considerable body of information relating to past and likely prospective moves of (inter alia) the applicants.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s490"">That letter indicated the AFP's purpose in making its request was that ""[t]he AFP would like to identify the source of the drugs and the organisers (other than CHAN) in Australia"".",Statement
"<sentence id=""s491"">In other words there was a rational and proper police purpose for the making of the request.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s492"">If there was to be a concurrent common law duty of care, this was the statutory and operational setting with which it had to be compatible: cf Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [147].",Statement
"<sentence id=""s493"">108 Secondly, there was no contact between the AFP and any of the applicants at all let alone contact that could lead Scott Rush or any of the others to reasonably believe or expect that the AFP had assumed some tutelary responsibility for him or her on which each could rely.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s494"">109 The Myer-Patching communications were directed to Lee Rush, not to the applicants generally or to Scott Rush in particular.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s495"">I assume for the purposes of this application, that those communications led Lee Rush reasonably to believe that AFP officers would and did speak to Scott Rush at Sydney airport and because of this he did not go to Bali to save his son from committing any offence.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s496"">I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s497"">However, it is not the failure to warn as such that underpins the alleged negligence of the AFP officers.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s498"">Rather it appears to be said that, having regard (a) to the alleged provision of information by or on behalf of Lee Rush to Patching about the apprehended criminal activity by Scott Rush, and (b) the request for assistance in relation to Scott Rush's departure from Sydney and the alleged representation that it had been given, the AFP's failure to act against this background may have authored a duty not to use the information in a way that put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s499"">Hence it is said there is reasonable cause to believe that he may have a right to obtain relief from the relevant AFP officers in a negligence action in this Court.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s500"">110 It is unnecessary to enlarge here on the question whether this Court would have jurisdiction in any event to entertain such a suit in negligence in the Northern Territory against members of the AFP as Commonwealth officers.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s501"">I simply adhere to the affirmative view I expressed on a similar question arising in the Australian Capital Territory in O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s502"">My reasoning in that case is ""equally applicable to the Northern Territory"": ALRC Report 92, The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth, 652 (2001).",Statement
"<sentence id=""s503"">111 The proposed negligence claim could well be described as a mutated form of breach of confidence action with the important difference that the duty said to be owed by the AFP officers was not owed to the supplier of the information, i.e.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s504"">Lee Rush, but to the subject of it, i.e.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s505"">Scott Rush.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s506"">Furthermore the limitation on the use of that information proposed by the applicants is a narrow one.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s507"">It is not that the AFP could not use the information supplied at all.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s508"">Rather it could not be used in a way that would put Scott Rush at risk of exposure to the death penalty in Indonesia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s509"">112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s510"">The disclosures related to apprehended serious criminal misconduct: cf Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (1987) 14 FCR 434 esp at 456.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s511"">And a court would not enforce any contractual or equitable obligation relating to such information, the effect of which would have been to obstruct the administration of the criminal law: A v Hayden [1984] HCA 67 ; (1984) 156 CLR 532.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s512"">113 Recasting the matter in terms of a duty of care owed to Scott Rush does not advance the matter.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s513"">While it is said that the AFP had assumed a responsibility for Scott Rush in the circumstances surrounding the Myer/Lee Rush provision of information to AFP officers, the basis for such an assumption of responsibility has not been explained.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s514"">Neither has any possible justification been advanced for there being a concurrent duty of care to Scott Rush alongside the public law duties of the AFP officers concerned.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s515"">114 There is a short answer to the alleged duty.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s516"">Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act, or had acted, in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so, neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer-Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s517"">The proposed duty would be inconsistent with the duty owed by the AFP to the public at large in the conduct of its investigations into the Bali drug trafficking operation: cf Sullivan v Moody at [60].",Statement
"<sentence id=""s518"">115 I have already indicated that the AFP officers concerned did not act in contravention of the AFP Act in deciding to, and in making, the 8 and 12 April 2005 communications to the INP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s519"">They were acting in performance of their functions under the AFP Act and consonantly with ministerial directions.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s520"">The communications made had a proper and rational purpose in the furtherance of that police investigation.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s521"">The proposed duty would only qualify and impede the conduct of the investigation embarked upon by the AFP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s522"">It would elevate the interests of Scott Rush over the public interest that the AFP was serving under its legislation to the extent that the two collided, as it did in the making of the request to the INP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s523"">116 If, as the other applicants seem to suggest albeit faintly, a like duty was owed them its obvious effect would have been to compromise the investigation itself in an important respect.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s524"">No assistance of the type sought could have been asked of the INP notwithstanding that the investigation involved transnational criminal activity and that the assistance in fact sought, as I have noted, was for a proper purpose in furtherance of the AFP's statutory functions.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s525"">117 In the cases of Scott Rush and of the other applicants the duty contended for cannot be reconciled with the nature and purpose of the functions being exercised by the AFP officers concerned, the discretions conferred on them in virtue of the task they were involved in, and the policy directive they were, apparently, implementing: cf Sullivan v Moody at [62].",Statement
"<sentence id=""s526"">Accordingly, to adopt Santow JA's observations in Cran v State of New South Wales at [63], the greater public interest accorded unimpeded investigation by the AFP precludes in this case any duty of care owed to Scott Rush or to the other applicants.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s527"">Such is the current law in this country and the policy informing it, that the interests of the applicants were subordinated to the public interests served by the AFP in their conduct of the investigation in question.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s528"">118 I should add for the sake of completeness that I do not consider that it would make any difference to this conclusion if it was the case that the AFP officers concerned had knowingly misled Lee Rush for the purposes of securing the Bali investigation from potential compromise (given its purpose as revealed in the 8 April 2001 request) and the stage reached in the AFP's own investigations.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s529"">Whatever the moral wrong to a caring parent that may have been involved in so doing, it could not have authored a duty of care such as has been proposed in this application.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s530"">119 No order for either identity discovery or information discovery will be made in relation to the intended cause of action based on the alleged possible negligence of AFP officers.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s531"">That proceeding would have no prosects of success.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s415"">From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function, but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s416"">In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s417"">The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police cannot be excluded.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s418"">Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done, with the result that he went on to commit further crimes.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s419"">While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure --- for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar --- others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation, as indeed the present action would seek to do.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s420"">The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion, for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s421"">Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question, yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s422"">A great deal of police time, trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s423"">The result would be a significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function, that of the suppression of crime.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s424"">Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed, not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s425"">I therefore consider that Glidewell LJ, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal [1988] QB 60, 76 in the present case, was right to take the view that the police were immune from an action of this kind on grounds similar to those which in Rondel v Worsley [1967] UKHL 5 ; [1969] 1 AC 191 were held to render a barrister immune from actions for negligence in his conduct of proceedings in court.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s509"">112 It need hardly be said that the disclosures of information about Scott Rush made by or on behalf of Lee Rush to AFP officers could not give rise to a duty of confidence to Lee Rush such as would prevent its use by the AFP in its investigations into drug trafficking into Australia.",Statement

"<sentence id=""s41"">I should indicate that I have not been asked in the circumstances to make findings in relation to contested issues of fact in the material before me, the respondent being prepared to accept that their resolution is for another day, if at all.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s42"">10 The annexures to several of the affidavits contain documents derived from the Dossier (or book of documents) relied upon by the prosecutor as evidence in the prosecution of the second applicant, Renae Lawrence, in the criminal proceedings in the Denpasar District Court in respect of an offence under Art 82(1) of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No 22 of 1997 concerning Narcotics.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s43"">The Dossier contained documents obtained by Indonesian Police as part of their investigation and has been made a public document by order of the Indonesian Court.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s44"">Reference will be made below to translations of a number of these documents.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s45"">11 The four applicants are Australian citizens.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s46"">On 6 April 2005, Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens travelled to Bali.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s47"">Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj travelled to the same destination on 8 April 2005.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s48"">12 Prior to Rush's departure from Australia, his father, Lee Rush, became aware he may have been travelling to Indonesia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s49"">Lee Rush was concerned that Scott might have been travelling to Bali to be involved in illegal activity and, according to his evidence, he was determined to help save him from committing any offence in Bali.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s50"">13 Lee Rush contacted a barrister and family friend, Robert Myers, to seek advice.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s51"">Myers had acted for Scott Rush on a number of minor criminal prosecutions concerned, in the main, with dishonesty offences.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s52"">Myers in turn contacted a friend of his, Damon Patching, a member of the Queensland Police Service who was at the relevant time seconded to the AFP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s53"">Before referring to the evidence of Mr Myers and Mr Patching, I foreshadow that there are important differences between each's account of their several conversations particularly in relation to what Mr Patching is alleged to have said would be done, and had subsequently been done, by the AFP at Sydney Airport in relation to Scott Rush.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s54"">14 Myers' evidence is that he requested that Rush be detained at Sydney airport and prevented from leaving Australia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s55"">He referred to Rush's prior convictions.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s56"">It was the case that Rush was on bail at the time.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s57"">Myers went on that if the AFP could not detain Rush he should be stopped at his point of exit and be advised that the AFP were aware he was ""up to no good"", that he would be watched in Bali and that it would be foolish for him to participate in illegal activity there.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s58"">15 Patching, according to Myers, said the AFP would talk to Rush if a passport alert (""a PACE alert"") was activated.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s59"">He was later told by Patching that this had occurred and that Rush had been spoken to at the airport.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s60"">Myers then spoke to Lee Rush and told him that, given what the AFP had done, he and Lee Rush had done all they could conceivably do and there was no necessity for Lee Rush to go to Bali to stop Scott.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s61"">16 Lee Rush's evidence of his conversations with Myers corroborated Myers' accounts and it was because of those conversations that he desisted from going immediately to Bali to stop his son committing any offence.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s62"">17 Mr Patching's evidence was that in one of his conversations with Myers he indicated he would contact Ashley Durre, another Queensland Police Service Officer on secondment with the AFP.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s63"">It was agreed with Durre that Patching should arrange for a PACE alert to be placed on Scott Rush.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s64"">Patching contacted Federal Agent Osseily who handled PACE alert matters at Sydney Airport, who activated the alert.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s65"">Osseily, Patching said, informed him he did not think ""it was a goer"" for the AFP to approach Scott and to warn him he was of interest to the police.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s66"">Patching said he knew at the time it would be unusual for police to make such an approach.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s67"">When he later rang Robert Myers and was asked whether Scott Rush would be approached and spoken to by the police, Patching deposed he said that ""may be looked at as a possibility ... depending on the circumstances"".",Statement
"<sentence id=""s68"">He denied he gave any assurance that Rush would be approached.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s69"">The next day Patching received a call from Federal Agent Collins at Sydney Airport.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s70"">Collins asked him whether Rush's bail conditions would prevent him leaving the country.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">After enquiries in Queensland, Patching informed Collins they would not.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">He also told Collins that Lee Rush wanted Scott to be approached.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">Collins commented this was not usual practice.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74"">Patching denied he gave Myers an assurance or undertaking at any stage that Scott Rush would be approached.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">18 Mr Durre's affidavit corroborated Patching's evidence in his recall of conversations with Patching to the extent he was present at and overheard telephone conversations Patching had with others including Myers.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">19 Mr Osseily's evidence described the PACE alert system.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">It is maintained by the Australian Customs Service.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">It is used by particular Federal and State agencies both as a means of gathering intelligence on persons entering or leaving Australia and also as a means of preventing certain targeted individuals from entering or leaving the country.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">20 Mr Osseily said he created the PACE alert on Scott Rush on the basis of information that his bail conditions prevented him from departing Australia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s80"">He derived this information from Patching.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s81"">21 Mr Collins, who was on duty at the AFP office at Sydney Airport on 8 April, gave evidence that he was informed that morning of the alert on Scott Rush and that the basis of it was that Rush's bail conditions stipulated he was not allowed to depart Australia.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s82"">He spoke to Patching and was told of Lee Rush's concern about Scott's visit to Bali.",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">Collins then contacted the relevant Queensland State Police and ascertained that there were no bail conditions preventing him leaving the country.",Statement

"<sentence id=""s25"">The Tribunal reviewed those decisions under s 273GA(2) of the Customs Act .",Statement

"<sentence id=""s27"">The Tribunal reviewed Customs' decision to refuse this refund application pursuant to s 273GA(1)(haaa).",Statement
"<sentence id=""s28"">All of the decisions under review were made on the basis that the products should be classified under sub-heading 3808.10.90 of Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act .",Statement

"<sentence id=""s102"">Ground three asserts that his Honour either failed to find whether the appellants understood the correct position concerning the turnover after the Meeting or to give adequate reasons for any implicit finding to that effect.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s103"">28 The appellants' case was that both appellants were at the Meeting when Mr Ross confirmed the turnover of approximately $4000 per week.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s104"">His Honour found that at the time of Mr Featherston presenting the correcting information to Mr Hinds, Mrs Hinds was elsewhere engaged in the room.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s105"">His Honour then stated at [94(f)] that he did not exclude the possibility that Mr Hinds failed to tell his wife about the true effect of the figures shown to him by Mr Ross at the Meeting.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s106"">He also stated that little turned on the issue and went on to say that he had found Mr Ross dealt with Mr Hinds and accurately disclosed the relevant figures to him.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s107"">29 The appellants contend the issue was whether what occurred at the Meeting removed the misleading effect of the earlier misrepresentation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s108"">The submission is made that even if Mr Hinds knew the true position (which is disputed) his knowledge would not be imputed to Mrs Hinds: McMahon v Pomeray Pty Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-125 at 52,859; Collier v Electrum Acceptance Pty Ltd (1986) 66 ALR 613; C Lockhart, The Law of Misleading or Deceptive Conduct , 2 nd edn, LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia, 2003 at [10.20].</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s109"">30 The second respondent submits that in the absence of a positive finding by his Honour that Mr Hinds did not advise Mrs Hinds of the corrected figures on turnover, his knowledge could be imputed to Mrs Hinds as joint purchaser of the business.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s110"">31 The Meeting occurred on 8 January 2004.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s111"">The Sale Agreement was executed in writing by the appellants on 10 January 2004.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s112"">In it the appellants covenanted to purchase the business: no words of severance were used, so that their purchase was as joint tenants.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s113"">32 The Sale Agreement did not expressly refer to the appellants intending to conduct the business as a partnership.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">Section 7 of the Partnership Act 1895 (WA) provides that a partnership arises where there is a relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">Section 23 provides that notice to any partner who habitually acts in the partnership business of any matter relating to partnership affairs operates as notice to the firm, except in the case of a fraud on the firm committed by or with the consent of that partner.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">Collier is authority that where the notice is given prior to the formal constitution of the partnership, it may not operate as notice to all partners.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">33 As stated above his Honour found that little turned on the issue of whether Mr Hinds had failed to tell his wife about the true effect of the figures shown to him by Mr Ross at the Meeting.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">This was because Mr Ross dealt with Mr Hinds to whom he had accurately disclosed the relevant figures.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">34 Even if his Honour implicitly and incorrectly reasoned that notice to Mr Hinds constituted notice to Mrs Hinds, he was not in error in reaching the view at [94(f)] that little turned on the issue.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">This is because his ultimate findings were to the effect that the appellants did not rely upon any of the representations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s121"">Depending on how his Honour's words in the subparagraph are to be understood the ground is therefore either not made out or, if made out, cannot support the orders sought on the appeal.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s268"">The accounts show that the debt arose over the period from August 2002 to March 2003.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s269"">In his oral evidence, Scott asserted that he had made an arrangement with Missen of MBA in December 2002 and January 2003 to the effect that MBA would wait three to four months for payment of the debt.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s270"">81 It is difficult to reconcile this assertion with other evidence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s271"">In their respective reports as to the affairs of TSIA, both Scott and Fairbank said that TSIA owed a debt of $11,728.00 to MBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s272"">There was no mention that a payment arrangement had been entered into in respect of this debt.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s273"">There is no written record of the payment arrangement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s274"">In addition, Fairbank answered the liquidator's questionnaire in relation to the affairs of TSIA by saying that MBA had pressed for payment of its debt for months.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s275"">I do not accept that any payment arrangement was made with MBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s276"">82 It will be apparent from the foregoing that I reject the evidence given by Scott and Fairbank concerning these payment arrangements as self-serving and untruthful.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s277"">I infer that they did not raise these claims concerning payment arrangements earlier because they were incapable of being supported by admissible evidence and would not withstand investigation if prior notice were to be given.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s278"">83 In any event, even if I were to have regard to the payment arrangements asserted by Scott and Fairbank in respect of one or more of the creditors in question, it would not alter my conclusions as to the insolvency of TSI and TSIA throughout the six month relation back period.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s279"">There were other debts which were not paid by each company as and when they fell due during the relation back period.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s280"">Further, given these other debts, the claim that various payment arrangements were entered into with creditors serves to underlie the fact that the company did not have the financial capacity to meet its debts as and when they fell due during the relation back period.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s331"">Scott deposed that in total Swift Malaysia provided approximately $861,544.00 to TSI and TSIA, of which $461,500.00 approximately was provided under the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s332"">Scott also said that, until 13 May 2003, whenever he made a request for payment of any liability of either TSI and TSIA, those payments were made by Swift Malaysia and he had no reason to expect that those payments would not continue.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s333"">According to Scott, the position changed on 13 May 2003 when Bayoud told him that Swift Malaysia was no longer able to provide financial support to TSI and TSIA in accordance with the terms of the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s334"">89 In his oral evidence, Scott confirmed that the arrangements with Swift Malaysia were embodied in the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s335"">However, he also made a series of far-reaching assertions about the effect of the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s336"">In his evidence in chief, he asserted that the July agreement contained an undertaking by Swift Malaysia to pay the then known liabilities of TSI and TSIA as and when they arose.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s337"">He then elaborated that the agreement was that Swift Malaysia would pay any and all debts as they arose from the time of entering that agreement and onwards.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s338"">Later in his evidence, Scott said that the undertaking by Swift Malaysia to be responsible for the liabilities of TSI and TSIA was the quid pro quo for the transfer of the shares in TSI and TSIA from TSI Inc to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s339"">The shares in TSI and TSIA were never transferred by TSI Inc to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s340"">When asked why would Swift Malaysia go on paying liabilities of TSI and TSIA when there was no performance of the corresponding obligation of TSI Inc to transfer shares to Swift Malaysia, Scott said that it was the arrangement that had been entered into and Swift was receiving the benefit of the output of the services of TSI for its own purposes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s341"">90 In his affidavit sworn 10 March 2006, Fairbank also said that the agreement with Swift Malaysia was embodied in the July agreement and that, of the $861,544.00 provided by Swift Malaysia to TSI and TSIA, the sum $461,554.00 was provided pursuant to the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s342"">In his oral evidence and in submissions, Fairbank made similar assertions to Scott as to the effect of the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s343"">91 The July agreement was an agreement between Swift Malaysia and TSI Inc; neither TSI nor TSIA was a party to it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s344"">The crux of the agreement was that Swift Malaysia agreed to purchase, and TSI Inc agreed to sell, all of its shares in TSI and TSIA, subject to the provisions of the agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s345"">In consideration of the sale of those shares, Swift Malaysia agreed to take over and be responsible for the liabilities of TSI and TSIA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s346"">The plain and natural meaning of these provisions is that Swift Australia was agreeing to take over and assume responsibility for the then known liabilities of TSI and TSIA as they stood at the date of sale.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s347"">As set out in paragraph 2 of the letter, Swift Australia wished to verify the amount of those liabilities by reference to up to date and accurate financial statements for the companies.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s348"">This was not entirely agreed by paragraph 2 of the clarifications: words were added providing that, as an alternative to up to date financial statements, Swift Malaysia would be given full access to all of the financial records of the companies.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s349"">92 In critical respects, the July agreement was never performed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s350"">TSI Inc did not transfer any shares in TSI or TSIA to Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s351"">Swift Malaysia was not provided either in July 2002 or at any time thereafter with up to date financial statements for TSI or TSIA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s352"">The existing board members of TSI and TSIA did not resign, and Swift Malaysia did not have its nominated directors appointed to TSI or TSIA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s353"">Although the activities of TSI and TSIA were reduced after July 2002, there is no evidence that the ongoing operations of those two companies were put into hibernation to the extent contemplated by paragraph 4 of the letter.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s354"">There is no evidence of any business plan for the hibernation phase, or any proposed model to relaunch the retail product, being provided to Swift Malaysia within two weeks of 17 July 2002 or at all.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s355"">93 I do not accept that the July agreement had the far-reaching effect asserted by Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s356"">Specifically, I do not accept that the July agreement contained any undertaking or promise by Swift Malaysia to pay the on-going liabilities of TSI and TSIA, regardless of the lack of performance of the other conditions set out in the agreement, including the transfer of the shares in TSI and TSIA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s357"">94 The evidence establishes that Swift Malaysia provided substantial advances from time to time to assist TSI and TSIA to meet pressing liabilities.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s358"">I am satisfied that these were ad hoc loan arrangements between related companies.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s359"">The funds provided by Swift Malaysia were recorded in the books of account of TSI and TSIA as loan funds.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s360"">In his evidence, Scott said that the payments made by Swift Malaysia to TSI and TSIA were recorded as loans on the basis that the loans were to be repaid after research and development activities had been completed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s361"">This is not consistent with the proposition that the funds were provided as a matter of obligation under the terms of the July agreement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s362"">The funds were not provided by Swift Malaysia pursuant to any legally binding commitment enshrined in the July agreement or otherwise.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s363"">95 I have given careful consideration to the evidence given by Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s364"">I carefully observed their demeanour when they were giving evidence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s365"">In my opinion, neither Scott nor Fairbank was a reliable or truthful witness.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s366"">In the absence of corroborating evidence, I am not prepared to act on their assertions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s367"">In particular, I reject their evidence that Swift Malaysia was bound by the July agreement to provide funds to TSI and TSIA to enable those companies to discharge their liabilities as and when they arose.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s368"">I am satisfied that Swift Malaysia never undertook any such obligation and, moreover, that it did not perform such an obligation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s369"">96 I am also satisfied that the funds actually advanced by Swift Malaysia directly, or via Swift Australia, to TSI and TSIA were not sufficient to enable either TSI or TSIA to pay their debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s370"">On the contrary, there is clear evidence that TSI and TSIA never had sufficient funds, whether from Swift Malaysia or elsewhere, to pay all of their debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s371"">It does not avail the directors to say that they used funds provided by Swift Malaysia to pay some of the larger and more pressing debts of TSI and TSIA, especially those, such as the debt to the Commissioner, which might expose the directors to personal liability.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s372"">As Kirby P said in FAI Insurances Limited v Gold Leaf Interior Decorators Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 643 at 649, a company's failure to pay a small debt may often be the best possible evidence of the company's insolvency.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s373"">97 Given my factual findings, the decision in Lewis does not assist the directors.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s374"">In any event, that was a very different case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s375"">There, a corporate reconstruction had resulted in a number of intercompany loans.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s376"">Following the reconstruction, over a period of slightly more than three years, the company paid all of its debts as and when they fell due with the assistance of funds provided by other companies in the group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s377"">Over that period, there was no evidence of any of the usual indicia of insolvency, such as unpaid group tax or payroll tax or other unpaid debts.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s378"">Most importantly, the funds provided by other group companies were sufficient at all relevant times to enable the company to discharge its debts as and when they fell due: see at 570-573 [74]-[82].</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s379"">The present case is very different, in that the related company was never providing sufficient funds to enable TSI and TSIA to pay their respective debts as and when they fell due.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s381"">In the second proceeding concerning TSIA, the liquidator alleges that six payments, totalling $66,827.05, were unfair preferences.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s382"">99 To establish these contentions, the liquidator must establish three things: (1) the payments were transactions; (2) the Commissioner received the payments in his capacity as a creditor; and (3) each payment resulted in the Commissioner receiving in respect of an unsecured debt more than he would receive if he proved for that debt in the winding up.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s383"">100 There was no dispute as to the last requirement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s384"">The liquidator gave evidence that he did not expect to make any payment to unsecured creditors in either liquidation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s385"">Consequently, by receiving and retaining the benefit of the payments identified by the liquidator, the Commissioner would, in the words of the statutory test, receive from the company in respect of the debt 'more than the creditor would receive from the company in respect of the debt if the transaction were set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s386"">101 In my opinion, each relevant payment was a transaction within the meaning of s 9 of the Act.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s387"">In the first proceeding, TSI was a party to each payment made to the Commissioner; the payment was either made pursuant to a garnishee order on TSI's bank account or, in one case, by TSI paying an amount to the Commissioner by a cheque drawn on its bank account.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s388"">In the second proceeding, each alleged unfair preference payment was made by TSIA by cheque drawn on its bank account.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s389"">102 The basis upon which Scott and Fairbank contended that the payments were not transactions was utterly misconceived.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s390"">They argued that many of the payments were made directly by Swift Malaysia, or at least using monies that had been provided by Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s391"">Alternatively, it was put that the payments were really made by or on behalf of the employees from whose wages tax deductions had been made.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s392"">In fact, none of the relevant payments now in issue were made directly by Swift Malaysia or Swift Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s393"">It is irrelevant to the definition of transaction in s 9 that the company in question may have used funds borrowed from Swift Malaysia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s394"">The argument that the payments were really made by or on behalf of employees fails to take account of the relevant legislative provisions: see Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), ss 255 -1 and 255 -5; and Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), s 2(2) and s 3AA and Sch 1 (especially ss 12 -35, 12 -45, 16 - 5 , 16 -25, 16 -70, 16 -75 and 16 -80).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s395"">Broadly stated, the effect of these provisions is that a company is legally obliged to withhold amounts from wages on account of income tax, the amounts withheld must be paid to the Commissioner, and the amounts withheld constitute a debt that is due and payable by the company to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s396"">103 In each proceeding, the impugned payments constitute transactions within the meaning of s 9 , and the amounts in question were received by the Commissioner in its capacity as a creditor of the relevant company.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s397"">104 I have already found that all of the relevant payments were made at a time when TSI or TSIA (as the case may be) was insolvent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s398"">Accordingly, each unfair preference payment was also an insolvent transaction within the meaning of s 588FC.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s493"">Both the liquidator and the Commissioner argue that the settlement was reached at a mediation in which Scott and Fairbank participated and, but for the unsuccessful arguments raised by Scott and Fairbank in this proceeding, final orders could have been made disposing of the whole proceeding on 14 November 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s494"">131 While I consider that the liquidator is entitled to recover costs from Scott and Fairbank, it would be too harsh to run the calculations from 14 November 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s495"">The more appropriate date from which to calculate costs is 13 December 2005, being the date upon which Finkelstein J made directions for the contested hearing of these two proceedings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s496"">Aside from the settlement agreement between the liquidator and the Commissioner, the liquidator would have been entitled to recover interest from the Commissioner in each proceeding pursuant to s 51A(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s497"">In the ordinary course, interest would relate to the period from the date of demand by the liquidator for the repayment of the preferences until the date upon which such preferences were repaid: Ferrier v Civil Aviation Authority (1994) 55 FCR 28 at 92-93.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s498"">In these proceedings, however, the liquidator did not advance any claim for the recovery of interest from the Commissioner, save and to the extent that the orders proposed in the first proceeding include an agreed amount of $16,865.33 in respect of interest and costs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s499"">The liquidator has not advanced any cause of action against Scott and Fairbank that would entitle him to recover interest directly from them.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s500"">Furthermore, the Commissioner has not made any claim for the recovery of interest from Scott and Fairbank.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s501"">The Commissioner's only entitlement against Scott and Fairbank is for an indemnity under s 588FGA and as the Commissioner is not exposed to any liability for interest in respect of the period after 14 November 2005, there is no basis for claiming interest against Scott and Fairbank in respect of that period.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s502"">In my opinion, it is not appropriate to order that Scott and Fairbank make any payment of interest to the liquidator.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s503"">132 As for the order that Scott and Fairbank pay $46,126.15 to the Commissioner, the figure has two components.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s504"">The first component represents that part of the total payments of $38,319.55 that reflects the payment of ITW liabilities, namely $29,260.82.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s505"">The second component represents the sum agreed between the Commissioner and the liquidator for interest and costs of $16,865.33.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s506"">In my opinion, the second component is excessive.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s507"">As I have explained, it needs to be reduced to take account of the fact that ITW liabilities represented only 76.36 per cent of the total figure of $38,319.55.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s508"">Applying this percentage produces a figure of $12,878.37 for interest and costs, which I consider to be the appropriate measure of the Commissioner's loss and damage in this respect.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s509"">133 It follows that the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3) above must be adjusted by substituting the amount of $42,139.19 for the sum of $46,126.15 proposed by the Commissioner.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s510"">134 I consider that Scott and Fairbank should be ordered to pay the Commissioner's costs of and incidental to the cross-claim.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s511"">135 Some adjustments must also be made to the orders which the liquidator and the Commissioner seek in the second proceeding.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s13"">5 ASIC drew attention to two possible questions beyond the issue raised which might cast doubt upon making of the direction as sought.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s15"">The second is whether a resolution purporting to fix the remuneration, inter alia, of partners and staff of an administrator, relevantly deals with the remuneration of the administrator for the purposes of s 449E in the case of resolutions 1 and 2.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s16"">I shall return to the procedural question having considered the substance of the matter at issue.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s28"">The first meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 436E of the Act on 27 June 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s29"">The second meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 439A of the Act on 15 July 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s30"">At that meeting, the creditors resolved that the company should execute a DOCA with Gidley as the deed administrator.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s31"">12 At the meeting of 15 July 2005, the creditors passed three resolutions that related to remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s32"">The first two resolutions related to the remuneration of the administrators of Aliance and the last resolution related to the remuneration of the administrator of the DOCA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s33"">The resolutions were as follows (numbered for ease of reference):",Statement
"<sentence id=""s49"">It could be ""fixed"" as a periodic salary, a lump sum, a percentage of some amount (such as the value of the company's assets under the administrators' control) or according to the amount of time spent by the administrator determined by reference to a scale or formula.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s50"">The matter is simply left at large.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s51"">So also is the basis upon which the quantum of the remuneration is to be determined.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s52"">That is, the section is silent on the factors to be taken into account both for deciding the appropriate method of ""fixing"" an administrator's remuneration and in determining the amount to be ""fixed"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s53"">The only guidance that is given, and it is given by necessary implication, is that an administrator is entitled to reasonable remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s54"">That offers little assistance to the tribunal that is required to decide what is reasonable in a particular case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s64"">On one view such approval does no more than fix the rate at which remuneration is to be charged; as the method sets no limit to the amount to be charged it may not ""fix"" the remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s65"">At least there must be real doubt about the validity of the practice.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s66"">It is not, however, a matter which I need resolve, for the issue does not arise squarely on the facts and no submissions were directed to the question.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s67"">To reach a concluded view would require consideration of, among other things, the knowledge of the practice by Parliament when the Companies Acts were re-enacted or amended.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s68"">If Parliament knew of the practice and did not change the statute that is relevant to its interpretation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s69"">I should say that if the practice be irregular that would not mean that a liquidator must complete his administration before he receives any remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s70"">He could be allowed interim remuneration while work is being performed, leaving the precise amount of his remuneration to be fixed when the winding up is complete.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">In any event, the problem may not be as large as at first it seems.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">Oftentimes, especially in a complex administration, it will be too difficult to fix fees prospectively having regard to the matters that should be taken into account, as I will later explain.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">For this reason courts have from time to time refused to fix fees prospectively: for instance Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74""> Be that as it may, whatever be the correct meaning of ""fixing"" remuneration, it was not ""fixed"" in this case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">The resolutions purporting to fix the administrators' remuneration did so by reference to the rates in the administrators' report.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">According to those rates work performed by persons occupying the same position could attract a different hourly charge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">There was no criteria by reference to which one could determine which hourly charge would be applied.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">In reality it was left to the administrators to decide what the rate would be.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">In this state of affairs it was the administrators and not the creditors who fixed their remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">That passage is consistent with a series of other decisions concerning the wartime regulations, decided at about the same time, including Vardon v Commonwealth [1943] HCA 30 ; (1943) 67 CLR 434; Cann's Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210; and King Gee Clothing Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s84"">20 It is submitted for the plaintiff that the resolutions in the present case do not suffer from the defect which existed in Stockford as there is only one rate fixed for each person who does any work in connection with the administration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s85"">Once the person and his or her category is known, and the time spent is known, the guide can be arithmetically applied to arrive at the result.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s86"">Thus, the resolution here does avoid one of the problems which brought down the arrangement in Stockford .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s87"">Counsel also relied upon the specific monetary limits or caps to avoid the criticism that the arrangements would otherwise be open ended.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s88"">21 It is submitted for ASIC, however, that whilst this formula may have the appearance of objectivity and certainty, that appearance is misleading.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s89"">It is submitted that the charge out rates cannot be applied until various issues involving a considerable degree of subjectivity, assessment, discretionary allocation or apportionment have been determined.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s90"">It is submitted that these subjective elements include assessing which tasks should be claimed for, apportioning the time taken on tasks that relate to more than just the particular administration in question, allocating the tasks to staff with the appropriate level of seniority, and assessing the actual number of hours to be claimed in respect of each task and of each member of staff having regard to such matters as, for example, work redone as a result of mistake or carelessness, the efficiency or inefficiency of the staff member, the quality of the work and so on.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s91"">It is submitted that these discretionary elements mean that, in effect, the actual fixing of the amount is left to the administrators rather than to the creditors or to the Court as provided for by the Act.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s92"">This is said to be an impermissible delegation of power ( Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50 ; (1979) 142 CLR 460 at 481).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s93"">It is submitted that all that is fixed is a rate for certain tasks rather than remuneration for the work done or to be done.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s94"">22 ASIC pointed to the potential for abuse if the plaintiff's construction were adopted, bearing in mind that creditors may not be sufficiently well informed or have sufficient funds to properly scrutinise what was proposed or to bring the matter to the Court pursuant to s 449E(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s95"">It was also submitted that there are traditional methods of fixing remuneration other than by way of lump sum or time charging, for example, by way of a percentage of the value of assets dealt with.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s96"">Counsel for ASIC also did not accept that, generally speaking, remuneration could or should be fixed prospectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s97"">23 It is submitted for ASIC that, according to the plaintiff's construction, the power to 'fix' remuneration is conferred in general terms and applies whether or not the administrator has performed all or any of the services for which he or she is to be remunerated.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s98"">In other words, remuneration may be both retrospective and prospective.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s99"">There is nothing to suggest that 'fix' will have a different meaning when considering prospective remuneration as opposed to retrospective remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s100"">It is submitted that it would be insufficient when fixing retrospective remuneration on a time basis for decision making bodies simply to be given the hourly charge out rate for approval.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s101"">More would be required.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s102"">This should also be the case in fixing prospective remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s103"">It is also submitted that, as a court has the power to 'fix' fees, it is to be assumed that the Court would require similar information.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s104"">As this cannot be given in relation to prospective fixing, it follows that an hourly rate basis is inappropriate for all relevant purposes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s105"">24 It is submitted on behalf of ASIC that the relevant extrinsic material does not support the plaintiff's proposition.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s106"">The Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992 referred to the 1988 Law Reform Commission Report known as the 'Harmer Report' ( General Insolvency Inquiry , Australian Law Reform Commission, Report No 45 (1988) (Harmer Report) which, it is submitted, effectively rejected the approach contended for as follows:",Statement
"<sentence id=""s110"">25 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, as s 449E contemplates that remuneration may be fixed before all (or perhaps any) work is done either in the administration or under the DOCA, there would be serious practical problems if the view contended for by ASIC were adopted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s111"">It is most unlikely that the intended consequence of the legislation was that prospective remuneration could only be fixed by way of a specific monetary amount.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s112"">The size and complexity of administrations vary so much that the precise work to be undertaken may not be capable of reliable estimation in advance.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s113"">It may thus not be practicable to agree on a fixed amount.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">There would also be a tendency to 'load' the amount because of risk.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">If fees could only be fixed retrospectively, the administrator would be at risk as to his or her remuneration during the period when the work is required to be performed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">Further, additional meetings of creditors would be required, with consequent expense.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">26 It was also submitted for the plaintiff that the extrinsic material did not support ASIC's position and that the extract taken from the Harmer Report above (para [24]), referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992, in particular did not assist in deciding the present controversy as there is no sufficient connection between the recommendations of the Harmer Report, on the one hand, and the legislation as drafted some years later, on the other, to make the passage relied upon by ASIC a safe guide to construction of the section.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">27 Counsel for ASIC responded to the argument based upon practical inconvenience by suggesting that interim payments could be authorised, as suggested by Finkelstein J in Stockford (at [30]) or that a certain monetary sum could be fixed on the basis that the administrator should have the right to seek further remuneration at a later meeting (cf Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">(See also Re Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement); Korda (as joint and several deed administrators of Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement v The J Aron Corporation (2005) 53 ACSR 432; (2005) 23 ACLC 710; [2005] FCA 543.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">) ASIC suggested that the convenience of avoiding additional meetings be given little, if any, weight.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">It would follow that the remuneration of an administrator of a company under administration would normally be fixed substantially retrospectively, having in mind the timing and purpose of a s 439A meeting, but that of the administrator of a DOCA could be fixed prospectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">In the normal case, the deed might well include a clause relating to remuneration (as in this case) and there might also be a separate resolution in relation to remuneration at the meeting pursuant to s 439A which resolves to execute the deed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">Furthermore, there is no restriction as to when a s 445F meeting should take place.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">There will often be an expectation that a deed of company arrangement will be administered for a reasonably lengthy period of time although the same may not be true of the administration of a company, with some notable exceptions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">It follows that s 449E contemplates the fixing of remuneration prospectively, at least in many cases.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">29 In my opinion, there is no escape from the conclusion that, if remuneration is to be fixed prospectively, it may be fixed by reference to a formula based upon time, provided that the formula is objective enough to satisfy the tests laid down by the High Court in the wartime line of authority to which reference has been made.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">That is the ordinary and natural meaning of the provision.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">I see no warrant for departing from this meaning because of the extrinsic material which is equivocal at best.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">30 I appreciate the force of the concern expressed on behalf of ASIC as to the potential for abuse in relation to time charging which echoes concerns expressed by Finkelstein J and other judges.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s131"">That is not a reason for precluding it as a method of remuneration in an age where it has become ubiquitous in relation to the provision of professional services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">Parliament has provided the necessary safeguards.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">The first safeguard is that remuneration may only be fixed by a resolution of the company's creditors or by the Court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s134"">It may not be fixed by the administrator.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">The second safeguard is that there is a full review by the Court available on the application of any officer, member or creditor of the company.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">In my opinion, those safeguards ought to be allowed to operate without artificially constraining the concept of 'fixing' of remuneration by means of unexpressed implications.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">I should add that doubts expressed as to the application of s 449E have led to the utilisation of the extraordinary provisions of s 447A on many occasions to cure perceived problems including the authorisation of interim payments.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">In my opinion, Parliament would not have intended that this should be necessary.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">31 The resolutions in question in this case are capable of objective application.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">All of the necessary elements can be objectively identified.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">The person doing the work, that person's category and the period spent are all the elements required.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">The sum can be calculated or ascertained definitely.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">If that produces an unreasonable result by reason of the factors referred to by counsel for ASIC, or otherwise, then the remedy is an application for review by the Court pursuant to s 449E(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s144"">I do not agree that the effect of the resolutions here is to enable the plaintiff to fix the remuneration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s145"">I should add that, in my opinion, the provision for a cap is not relevant to deciding whether or not remuneration has been 'fixed'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s146"">At the time the resolution was passed, there was no certainty that the cap would be reached.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s147"">Therefore, it is not a sum certain.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s148"">A cap may, however, be relevant to the question of reasonableness which would arise if there is a challenge by any officer, member or creditor of the company to the remuneration fixed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s149"">32 I thus uphold the plaintiff's position on the critical issue concerning the proper construction of s 449E(1).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s150"">As pointed out earlier, ASIC has pointed to two other issues which might be said to go to the validity of the resolutions in question.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s151"">I make no comment as to whether those issues would in truth go to validity as no officer, member or creditor of the company has raised either of them.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s152"">Bearing in mind the limited nature and effect of giving a direction pursuant to s 447D, I propose to give the direction sought.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s153"">It will protect the plaintiff but does not bind others.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s154"">These reasons will make clear the limited basis upon which the direction is given.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s155"">33 It is not appropriate to make any order for the costs of this proceeding.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s156"">It has been brought in order to resolve a matter of general interest that has not been raised by any party interested in the particular company.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s157"">The result is to the benefit of the plaintiff.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s20"">7 Under s 7C of the ACC Act , the board of the ACC may determine in writing that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s21"">Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s22"">On 13 May 2003, the board of the ACC made a determination pursuant to this provision which was termed the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s23"">The special investigation extends to activities that may have involved the commission of offences against s 29D of the Crimes Act , ss 134.2(1) and 400 (4) of the Criminal Code Act, and s 82 of the 1987 Proceeds of Crime Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s24"">There is no challenge to the validity of this determination.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s25"">8 In its defence, the ACC explicitly admits that the warrant applications were made, and the warrants were executed, to assist with the ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s26"">9 For the sake of completeness, I should mention that the pleadings disclose one aspect of the facts where the applicant and the ACC adopt slightly different positions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s27"">The applicant alleges that, while each person successively named in each warrant was both a constable and a member of the staff of the ACC, he was appointed as executing officer in his capacity as a member of the staff of the ACC.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s28"">The ACC denies the latter part of this allegation, and pleads instead that each such person was appointed as executing officer in his capacity as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s29"">Mr Graham QC, senior counsel for the applicant, referred to these different positions, but confirmed that he did not rely upon the applicant's allegation as a ground for invalidating the warrant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s30"">He added that the applicant's contention supported the proposition that the warrants were executed for the purposes of the ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s31"">Given the ACC's explicit admission that the warrants were executed for the sole purpose of assisting the ACC special investigation, I consider that this minor difference in factual allegations is immaterial to the issues which I must consider.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s53"">The ACC combined the functions of the National Crime Authority (""NCA""), the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s54"">The functions of the ACC include the collection of criminal information and intelligence, the undertaking of intelligence operations, and the investigation of federally relevant criminal activity: see s 7A of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s55"">19 The expression 'federally relevant criminal activity' is explained by several definitions in s 4 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s56"">In summary, it refers to any circumstances implying, or any allegations, that a serious and organised crime may have been, may be being, or may in future be committed so as to give rise to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, or a law of a State that has a federal aspect.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s57"">20 The ACC does not itself have the power to institute criminal proceedings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s58"">Under s 12(1) , if the ACC obtains evidence of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, being evidence that would be admissible in a prosecution for the offence, it must assemble the evidence and provide it to the relevant law officer, law enforcement agency or prosecuting authority.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s59"">21 Section 22 of the ACC Act deals with the issue of search warrants.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s60"">For present purposes, the most pertinent sub-sections are (1), (5) and (10).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s61"">They provide:",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">For instance, s 3E requires that the issuing officer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material (as defined) at the premises to which the search warrant is to relate.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">Different pre-conditions are found in s 22(1) of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">The applicant for a warrant under s 22 must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a thing or things or a particular kind connected with a special ACC operation/investigation are at the specified premises and, in addition, the applicant must believe on reasonable grounds that if a summons were issued for the production of the thing or things they might be concealed, lost, mutilated or destroyed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74"">It follows that a warrant could be obtained under s 22 in circumstances where none could be obtained under s 3E, and vice versa.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">But it does not follow that the mere fact that a warrant might be obtainable under s 22 precludes the issuance of a warrant under s 3E.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">THE APPLICANT'S ARGUMENTS",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">First, the applicant argues that s 22 is a code or regime that sets out the ACC's powers in respect of search warrants, and represents the only source of power to issue search warrants when they are sought for the purpose of assisting an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">Second, the applicant argues that the purpose of search and seizure under s 3E of the Crimes Act is to obtain and preserve evidential material for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">According to the applicant, this means that Pt 1AA does not confer power to issue a search warrant whose sole purpose is to assist an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s80"">In reality, these two arguments may be different dimensions of a single argument, namely that Pt 1AA should be read down by reference to s 22.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s81"">Be that as it may, I propose to deal with the two arguments separately.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s82"">REJECTION OF THE APPLICANT'S CASE",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">27 In summary, I consider that there is no justification for reading down Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act by reference to s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s84"">The conditions and limitations in s 22 apply when an application is made for a search warrant under that section.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s85"">But if a staff member of the ACC can satisfy an issuing officer of the conditions set out in s 3E of the Crimes Act , nominates a constable to execute the warrant, and otherwise complies with all of the requirements of Pt 1AA , there is no reason why a search warrant cannot issue under s 3E.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s86"">The fact that the sole reason for applying for a search warrant under s 3E may be to assist a special investigation that is being undertaken by the ACC does not render s 3E inapplicable.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s87"">Section 3E does not impose any limitation of that kind.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s88"">Nor does it impose any limitation upon the persons who may apply for a warrant under it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s89"">28 Section 3D(2) puts the matter beyond doubt by making it plain that the search warrant power in s 3E may be used when Commonwealth offences are being investigated under another piece of Commonwealth legislation, notwithstanding the availability of a search warrant power under that other legislation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s90"">29 I now turn to a more detailed discussion of my reasons for rejecting the arguments advanced by the applicant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s91"">THE ACC ACT DOES NOT LIMIT PART 1AA OF THE CRIMES ACT",Statement
"<sentence id=""s92"">In effect, the applicant argues that s 22 is the only source of power to issue search warrants when they are sought for the purpose of assisting an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s93"">31 In my opinion, the argument is not sustainable.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s94"">In Ryder v Morley (1987) 16 FCR 257 ("" Ryder v Morley ""), the Full Court (Fox, Jenkinson and Wilcox JJ) rejected an identical argument in the context of s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s95"">The case concerned a search warrant that was issued to a detective sergeant in the Australian Federal Police.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s96"">He had been seconded to the NCA to assist it with a particular investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s97"">The applicant argued that a search warrant that was to be executed for the purposes of the NCA investigation must be issued pursuant to, and subject to the restrictions of, the NCA Act , including in particular s 22 thereof, and that s 10 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor of s 3E) cannot be prayed in aid of the warrant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s98"">32 At trial in Ryder v Morley (1986) 12 FCR 438, Toohey J held that the attachment of the detective sergeant to the NCA did not deprive him of his status as a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act , and nor did it deprive him of the right to seek the issue of a search warrant pursuant to s 10 of that Act.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s99"">His Honour did not see anything to preclude recourse being had to s 10 of the Crimes Act , as he explained in the following passage at 441:",Statement
"<sentence id=""s100"">Had a member of the Authority required a warrant for the purpose of a special function of the Authority, it was open to that member to apply to a judge of a prescribed court under s 22(1).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s101"">But the warrant was sought by a member of the Australian Federal Police who satisfied a justice of the peace, by information on oath, that a warrant was justified in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s102""> ""I agree with counsel for the respondents that the subsection simply means what it says and that there is no justification for reading it down.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s103"">Counsel for the applicants argued that if a police officer seconded to the Authority could rely upon s 22(10) to justify the obtaining of a warrant under s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , the limitations in s 22 could be set at naught.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s104"">But that is not so.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s105"">The limitations in s 22 apply when the Authority relies upon a special investigation which it is conducting to obtain a search warrant in the terms of that section.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s106"">But if a constable can satisfy a justice of the peace, in terms of s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 , that a search warrant is justified, the justice may issue a warrant under that section.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s107"">There is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about s 22(10) ; in my view the subsection is designed for the sort of situation that arose in the present case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">In my view, the supposed distinction is not made out.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">It is founded on a statement in the Full Court judgment that 'we do not know whether it was a ""special investigation"", which deals with a ""matter relating to"" a specified ""relevant criminal activity"", and is not confined to things used or believed to be intended to be used for the commission of a crime.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">' It is not clear whether the Full Court was saying that it did not know whether it was a special investigation at all, or whether it was saying that it did not know that the special investigation had the particular features it mentions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">However, it does not matter.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">The applicant's whole argument in Ryder v Morley invited the Court to assume that a search warrant could have been issued pursuant to s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s121"">In other words, the argument invited the Court to assume that the search warrant in question had been sought in connection with a special investigation by the NCA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">The Court was well aware that the power conferred by s 22(1) of the NCA Act could only be exercised in connection with a special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">The thrust of the argument the Court was addressing was that, as s 22 was available, the legislative intention was that it should apply to the exclusion of s 10 of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">Both Toohey J and the Full Court addressed the merits of this argument on the assumption that s 22 was available and that its conditions could have been satisfied.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">It follows that the observations made both by Toohey J and the Full Court concerning the relationship between s 22 of the NCA Act and s 10 of the Crimes Act were premised upon an assumption, favourable to the applicant in that case, that the warrant had been sought in order to advance a special investigation by the NCA and so could have been obtained under s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">35 For the foregoing reasons, I consider that Ryder v Morley is Full Court authority directly contrary to the argument that the applicant advances in this case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">Ryder v Morley was followed by Moore J in Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder [1997] FCA 1535 ("" Malubel) .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">One of the submissions made by the applicant in Malubel was to the effect that it was not open to the second respondent to make application under s 3E of the Crimes Act given the special provisions of s 22 of the NCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">His Honour dismissed the application and in doing so he referred with approval to Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">Moore J's decision was upheld on appeal by the Full Court (Burchett, RD Nicholson and Madgwick JJ): see Malubel Pty Ltd v Elder (1998) 88 FCR 242.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s131"">36 Since Ryder v Morley was decided, s 10 of the Crimes Act has been replaced by Pt 1AA , and there have been minor amendments to s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">However, s 22(10) is unchanged.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">In my opinion, none of these changes affects or in any way reduces the authority of Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s134"">37 When the ACC Act was enacted in 2002, s 22(10) was left in the form in which it was considered in Ryder v Morley , notwithstanding the introduction of Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act in 1994 by the Crimes Amendment Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">Viewed against the background of Ryder v Morley and the introduction of s 3D(2) into Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act , the retention of s 22(10) in unchanged form affords an indication that Parliament intended that in appropriate cases police officers who had been seconded to the ACC to assist it with a special investigation could apply for search warrants under Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act , provided of course that the requirements of Pt 1AA could be satisfied.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">38 The applicant also submitted that significant safeguards are incorporated in s 22 that are not found in Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">The most important of these was said to be that, under s 4 of the ACC Act , an issuing officer is defined to mean 'a Judge of the Federal Court, a Judge of a court of a State or Territory or a Federal Magistrate'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">It was said that, in contrast, the Crimes Act confers power to issue a search warrant upon a Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace and various court officials.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">Mr Robberds QC, senior counsel for the ACC, pointed out that essentially the same differences existed at the time that Ryder v Morley was decided: under s 22 of the NCA Act a search warrant application had to be made to a judge of a prescribed court, whereas the search warrant under challenge in Ryder v Morley had been issued by a Justice of the Peace.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">39 The applicant also submitted that sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) of s 22 contain further safeguards which have no direct equivalents in Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">Particular reference was made to the provisions of sub-section (5).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">40 The ACC submitted that the differences in safeguards between Pt 1AA and s 22 are marginal and no significant weight attaches to them in resolving the issues before the Court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">I agree with these submissions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s144"">In particular, when ss 22(1) , (3), (5) and (7) of the ACC Act are examined, it is apparent that a similar range of protections can be found in ss 3E(1) , (5) and (6)(a) and 3F (1)(c) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s145"">41 Even if there were significant differences between the safeguards attending Pt 1AA and those attending s 22 , any such differences could be relevant only to an argument that Pt 1AA should be read down by reference to s 22.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s146"">The argument that the Crimes Act should be read down so as to prevent the safeguards in s 22 being subverted was explicitly rejected by the Full Court in Ryder v Morley .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s147"">As will later appear, I also consider that any such reading down would be contrary to the plain language and intention of s 3D(2) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s148"">PART 1AA AUTHORISES THE ISSUE OF THE WARRANTS",Statement
"<sentence id=""s149"">It is unclear whether this contention is put independently of the argument that the ACC Act contains its own code or special regime for the issue of any search warrants that are required for the purposes of a special ACC operation or investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s150"">But, in any event, I have concluded that the contention is not supported by the language, context or purposes of Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s151"">43 The applicant's contentions about the limited scope of Pt 1AA are built upon the proposition that the purpose of search and seizure under ss 3E and 3F is to obtain and preserve evidential material for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s152"">In my view, this is too narrow a description of the functions and purposes of search warrants under Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s153"">44 The applicant relies on a statement by the responsible Minister in his second reading speech for the Crimes Amendment Bill that '[s]earch warrants will authorise the seizing of evidence of the offence to which the warrant relates as well as evidence of any other indictable offence': see Hansard, House of Representatives, 17 November 1993 at 3030.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s154"">As I read his speech, the Minister was simply describing in general terms certain uses to which a search warrant can be put.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s155"">His statement does not support the limitation that the applicant seeks to imply into Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s156"">45 More importantly, the limitation that the applicant would import into Pt 1AA is negated by the language of ss 3E and 3F.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s157"">Section 3E authorises the issue of a search warrant where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or will be within 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises in question.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s158"">Amongst other things, s 3F authorises the officer executing the warrant to search for and seize evidential material of the kind specified in the warrant, other evidential material found at the premises that relates to the offences specified in the warrant or other unspecified offences that are indictable offences, other evidential material or tainted property as those terms are defined in the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act , or seizable items as defined in s 3C of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s159"">Section 338 of the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act defines 'evidential material' quite differently from the way in which it is defined in s 3C of the Crimes Act : it means evidence relating to property in respect of which action has been or could be taken under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act , benefits derived from the commission of an indictable offence, or literary proceeds (being benefits derived from exploiting a person's notoriety resulting from the commission of an indictable offence).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s160"">Broadly summarised, s 338 defines 'tainted property' to mean the proceeds of an indictable offence, or property that was used, or was intended to be used, in or in connection with an offence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s161"">46 The definition of 'evidential material' in s 3C does not support an implication that the material in question must be seized for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s162"">When read with the definitions of a thing relevant to an indictable offence or summary offence in s 3 , the definition extends to anything with respect to which an offence is reasonably suspected to have been committed, anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence, or anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s163"">47 On the face of these provisions, it is impossible to confine them to evidential material that is for use in the criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s164"">Material that assists the investigation of suspected offences, but which is incapable of being used in the criminal prosecution process, falls squarely within the definition of evidential material.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s165"">Material of this kind would constitute something with respect to which an indictable offence has been committed or is reasonably suspected to have been committed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s166"">The expression ""with respect to"" has a wide meaning: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 526-527 and 556; and as to the cognate phrase 'in respect of', see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Scully [2000] HCA 6 ; (2000) 201 CLR 148 at 171.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s167"">48 The definition of a 'thing relevant to an indictable offence' in s 3 refers to things that might 'afford evidence' as to the commission of an offence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s168"">This concept is not to be understood narrowly.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s169"">In Adler v Gardiner (2002) 43 ACSR 24 at 29, in a passage quoted with approval by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 at 543, Hely J rejected a submission that documents fell outside the scope of a warrant issued under s 3E because the documents could never be admitted into evidence at a trial in relation to the warrant offences.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s207"">When the relevant passages in the judgment of the Full Court are read as a whole, it is plain that the Full Court was not suggesting that information can only be gathered under a search warrant if it serves the dual purpose of both determining whether offences have been committed and facilitating proof of them in a criminal prosecution process.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s208"">Moreover, I do not consider that the Full Court was referring to proof in a criminal prosecution process, as distinct from proof in the broader context of a criminal investigation that may or may not result in a prosecution.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s209"">52 The limitation that the applicant seeks to import into Pt 1AA is inconsistent with other authorities.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s210"">In Harts Australia Ltd v Australian Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 153, the Full Court (Hill, Cooper and Whitlam JJ) recognised that search warrants can be sought and issued at an early stage of an investigation when it is unclear whether any criminal prosecution will occur.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s211"">In Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 at [55] - [58] , the Full Court (Dowsett, Jacobson and Greenwood JJ) approved the statements in Hart that I have extracted and added that statutes such as Pt 1AA should not be construed narrowly but consistently with the operational reality applicable to the issue and execution of warrants.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s212"">53 In summary, I consider that the limitation that the applicant seeks to read into Pt 1AA has no basis in the language of Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s213"">Indeed, it conflicts with the text of both ss 3E and 3F .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s214"">It is, moreover, inconsistent with the operational reality applicable to the issue and execution of search warrants.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s215"">As a matter of history, statutory construction and authority, I consider that a search warrant can be issued under Pt 1AA in order to advance a criminal investigation, whether or not any decision has been made about the likelihood of a prosecution, and whether or not the material sought by the warrant is intended to be used, or is capable of being used, in a criminal prosecution.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s216"">SECTION 3D(2)",Statement
"<sentence id=""s217"">In my view, s 3D(2) is fatal to the applicant's argument.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s218"">Section 3D(2) expressly confirms that, despite the power conferred by s 22 of the ACC Act , members of the staff of the ACC may apply for warrants under Pt 1AA , provided that the requirements of s 3E are otherwise satisfied.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s219"">This interpretation of s 3D is supported by the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum, as I have already mentioned.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s220"">55 The applicant asserted that s 3D(2) is of no assistance to the ACC in seeking to rely on Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s221"">This assertion rested entirely on the two contentions that I have already rejected, namely that s 22 is an exclusive code that precludes recourse to Pt 1AA , and that Pt 1AA does not confer any power to apply for, or to issue, a search warrant where the sole purpose of the warrant is to assist an ACC special investigation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s222"">The latter contention was advanced by the applicant without addressing the meaning and effect of s 3D(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s223"">In that respect, the applicant's contention begs the question whether on the proper construction of Pt 1AA as a whole, including s 3D(2), it contains any limitation of the kind asserted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s224"">In my opinion, both for the reasons already given and because of the plain meaning and intended effect of s 3D, no such limitation can be imported into Pt 1AA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s225"">56 The applicant attempted to minimise the significance of s 3D(2) by describing it as a non-limitation provision which operated in a similar fashion to s 3D(1).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s226"">Section 3D(1) performs a different function from s 3D(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s227"">It confirms that Pt 1AA does not limit or exclude s 22 of the ACC Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s228"">It is not directly relevant in this case because the ACC did not invoke any powers under s 22.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s229"">On the other hand, s 3D(2) declares that the search warrant powers under Pt 1AA may be used even if another law of the Commonwealth, such as s 22 of the ACC Act , provides for the issuance and execution of search warrants.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s230"">In that way, as the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum stated, the purpose and effect of s 3D(2) is to remove any doubt that the search warrant powers under Pt 1AA may be used when Commonwealth offences are being investigated under other Commonwealth legislation, even if that other legislation contains search warrant powers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s231"">CONCLUSION",Statement
"<sentence id=""s232"">In my view, the search warrants were validly issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s233"">There is no challenge to the way in which the search warrants were executed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s234"">58 The application is dismissed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s235"">59 I order that the applicant pay the first respondent's costs of the proceeding, including reserved costs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s236"">As to reserved costs, the parties informed me at the hearing that they agreed that all reserved costs should follow the event.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s237"">I do not propose to make any order for costs that affects the position of the second respondent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s238"">I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">The Attorney-General relied on affidavits dated 17 August 2005 an 7 February 2005 by a legal officer of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ('ASIO') whose name has not been revealed in open court for reasons set out in those affidavits.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">I direct under section 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the name of the officer or any material capable of identifying him not be disclosed without leave of a judge of the court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">11 The material in the affidavits provided by the unnamed officer includes redacted electronic copies of the submissions which were before the Attorney-General and noted by him on the occasions on which he came to consider the issue of the earlier certificate and the certificate the subject of these proceedings dated 19 April 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">13 In essence, the material that was put to the Attorney-General by the Director-General asserted that, without any challenge to Mr Hopper's integrity or willingness to abide by his obligations under his security classification, there was a real risk of inadvertent disclosure by him.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">Among other reasons given as to why that may happen was the fact that Mr Hopper not only acted for the present applicant but had acted in the past and continues to act at present for other persons who are of interest to Australia's security services and to whom inadvertent disclosure may be, in effect, meaningful.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">14 The argument before me has tended to centre on the provisions of section 39A subsections (8) and (9), particularly because it is in those provisions that some exception to the blanket effect of a certificate can be made if the Attorney-General is prepared to consent to a person representing an applicant before the Tribunal being present when evidence is adduced or submissions made that are the subject of the certificate.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">However, each part of the statute must be construed separately, although the court will try to give an harmonious meaning to it as a whole: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at pp.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s173"">This was a point forcefully made by Hayne JA in the Mobile Oil Australia case where, at p 87, his Honour said: ""Once the documents are inspected by the principals of the trade rival the information which is revealed is known to the trade rival and cannot be forgotten.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s175"">To say that the trade rival is bound not to use the documents except for the purposes of the action concerned is, in a case such as this, to impose upon that trade rival an obligation that is impossible of performance by him and impossible of enforcement by the party whose secrets have been revealed.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s182"">Such a procedure, however, has its own disadvantages discussed in the cases including the quarantining of the individual to whom the poisoned chalice passes, from providing their services in particular areas and depriving the parties of the benefit of those services, and also creating a situation where agents of a principal are in that capacity put in possession of information, from access to which the principal is excluded.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s183"">'26 In my opinion, the considerations that the submissions made to the Attorney-General reveal about the potential but unsubstantiated risk that Mr Hopper might inadvertently disclose information were not an irrelevant consideration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s184"">The subject matter, scope and purpose of each of sections 36, 39A and 39B indicate that the Minister has an unconfined discretion to have regard to what he, as a high officer of the Executive, considers is in the public interest and may prejudice the security of Australia: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at p. 40 per Mason J; Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 62 ; (1979) 144 CLR 45 at pp.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s185"">49-50.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s186"">27 I am of opinion that one cannot read any of those sections in a way which confines the considerations which the Minister is able to take into account in forming a view as to whether or not a certificate should be issued only to considerations that are able to be substantiated in relation to risk.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s187"">This is particularly so where what is being looked at in the sections is the disclosure of, in effect, information and the ability to safeguard the spread of information which up to the time of the grant of the certificate has been regarded as confidential for, what are not challenged in these proceedings to be, good reasons.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s188"">28 In coming to the conclusion which he did, the Attorney-General was asked to consider whether Mr Hopper should be permitted under section 39A(9)(b) to be present in the Tribunal when evidence was adduced or submissions made which were the subject of the certificate.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s189"">The Attorney-General did not give his consent.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s192"">It was said by counsel for the applicant that the ASIO submission made to the Attorney-General on 21 February 2005 questioned, without a substantive basis, the extent to which, if Mr Hopper were present when the certificated evidence was given or submissions were made, he would be likely to assist the applicant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s193"">The ASIO submission to the Attorney-General relevantly recorded:",Statement
"<sentence id=""s194"">Mr Hopper would not, however, be able to tell his client anything which would disclose certificated evidence or related submissions.</sentence>",Statement

"29 This passage was criticised on the basis that it, again, raised concerns which were merely speculative.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s197"">I think that in essence the passage may capture, in part, the operation of section 39A(9)(b) and the consequence provided in subsection 39A(10).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s198"">That is to say, if Mr Hopper were present while the confidential material were adduced before the Tribunal, he would not, by force of section 39A(10), be able to reveal any of the material that he so gleaned or learned of to his client.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s199"">Moreover, it would put Mr Hopper into an invidious position at that time for he may then know his client has a perfectly good answer to some of the material, but he would not be free, directly or indirectly, to disclose that answer.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s200"">30 It was then submitted by counsel for the applicant that such a result would inevitably lead in every case to a situation in which consent could never be given.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s201"">I am not sure that that has validity, but it is necessary to consider the facts of the present case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s202"">There may well be cases where, for example, the Attorney-General forms a view as to the prejudice of a particular person having access but where he might form a different view as to the prejudice resulting from another person having access for the purposes of assessing prejudice to security under each of the three sections authorising the issue of certificates.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s14"">Its long title is 'An Act providing for Payments by way of Medical Benefits and Payments for Hospital Services and for other purposes.</sentence>",Statement
 Part II of the Act deals with Medicare Benefits.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s16"">Section 10 provides for the payment of benefits for 'medical expenses ... incurred in respect of a professional service' rendered to an eligible person.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s17"">A 'professional service' is, relevantly, a service to which an item in the general medical services table prescribed by the regulations relates, rendered by a medical practitioner, that is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.</sentence>",Statement
 The provisions of the Act relating to payments by way of medical benefits were enacted pursuant to s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution .</sentence>,Statement
" Under the Act, Medicare benefits are calculated by reference to the fees ('Schedule fees') for medical services set out in the tables prescribed in the Regulations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s20"">At the relevant time the amount of the benefit for each service was 85% of the Schedule fee.</sentence>",Statement
" To assist medical practitioners and the public, the tables (including the rules for their interpretation) in the Regulations are published annually by the Department of Health and Ageing in a publication entitled, 'Medicare Benefits Schedule Book', which is provided to all practitioners.</sentence>",Statement
 Medicare benefits are payable by the Health Insurance Commission ('Commission') on behalf of the Commonwealth to the patient.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s23"">However, a patient may enter into an agreement with the practitioner under which the patient assigns to the practitioner the right to payment of the Medicare benefit.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s24"">If such an agreement is entered into, the practitioner must accept the assignment in full payment of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s25"">Assignments provide the means by which the practitioner 'bulk-bills' the Commission in respect of services which attracted Medicare benefits.</sentence>",Statement
"6 In oral submissions, Mr Robertson SC who appeared for the respondents referred at length to the provision the scheme makes for a patient to assign his or her right to a benefit under the Medicare Scheme to the doctor who provides the medical service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s27"">He stressed that the practitioner's decision to accept an assignment of the benefit is entirely voluntary; there is no compulsion for any doctor to 'bulk-bill'.</sentence>",Statement
"7 The PSR Scheme was introduced in 1994 and was amended in 1997, 1999 and 2002.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s29"">It is the 1999 version that is relevant to this proceeding; that is the HIA as amended by the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999 (Cth) and the Health Legislation Amendment Act (No 3) 1999 (Cth), (together the Amending Acts) .</sentence>",Statement

'This Part creates a scheme under which a person's conduct can be examined to ascertain whether inappropriate practice (see section 82) is involved.</sentence>,Statement

"<sentence id=""s69"">The respondents did not object to the applicant relying on the extrinsic material although they made the point, correctly in my view, that such material is not evidence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s70"">They did object to evidence concerning Dr Selim's personal circumstances on the grounds that this evidence is not relevant to the debate as to the constitutional validity of the PSR Scheme.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">They submit that whether Part VAA is valid does not depend on its impact on the applicant as an individual; it cannot be the case that Part VAA is invalid with respect to the applicant and valid for everyone else.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">For this reason the factual propositions relevant to the constitutional challenge must be put at a general and not an individual level.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">It is for this reason, it is submitted, that the leading cases on s 51(xxiiiA) have not had an individual's personal circumstances as their factual base but have proceeded by way of a demurrer to a fully pleaded statement of claim or on a case stated.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74"">I agree with these submissions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">21 There is no challenge to Dr Selim's standing to bring the present proceeding.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">The respondents have accepted that should the applicant be disqualified from participating in the Medicare Scheme, then for the period of the disqualification the applicant's patients would not receive benefits in respect of the applicant's professional services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">The respondents accept that, depending on the length of any disqualification the applicant 'may lose a number of his patients'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">The pervasiveness of the Medicare Scheme and its role in covering an individual's medical expenses or, at least, in subsidising those expenses, is sufficiently well known generally as to allow me to take judicial notice of this and of its impact on medical practitioners who are unable to participate in the scheme; Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149 ; Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 144.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">It is not difficult to conclude that the consequences for a medical practitioner who is excluded from the scheme would be sufficiently serious.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s80"">The disadvantages of operating outside the Medicare Scheme are such as, in my view, to impose practical, if not legal compulsion, to participate in the Scheme.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s81"">22 The written submissions made on behalf of the applicant went into considerable detail about the repercussions for the applicant should he be disqualified from the Medicare Benefits Scheme for up to three years.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s82"">These included the virtual devastation of his practice and loss of his livelihood.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">As I have explained above these submissions are not relevant to the issue I have to decide.</sentence>",Statement

23 It is not in contention that medical practitioners are not obliged to participate in the Medicare Scheme.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s90"">Nevertheless, the applicant contends that the realities underlying the medical benefits scheme are such that 'realistically, economically and practically' it requires medical practitioners to become approved medical providers in order for them to practise as general practitioners.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s91"">The applicant submits that the HIA requires general practitioners to provide medical services in a manner designated as 'appropriate' but which is 'unstated and undefined'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s92"">According to the applicant, this dictates the 'kinds of and manner in which medical services are actually provided' and attaches significant sanctions to a failure to conform including disqualification from participation in the scheme for up to three years, public reprimand and/or the imposition of substantial repayments of Medicare benefits paid to them or assigned to them by their patients.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s93"">By so doing, the applicant submits, the HIA 'impermissibly' constitutes civil conscription.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s108"">The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s 51(xxiiiA) had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription; see also D Mendelson, ""Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee: The History of Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution "" (1999) 23 MULR 308 .</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s110"">At issue was the validity of s 7A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947 (Cth) which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s111"">It was an offence, carrying a penalty of [sterling]50, for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s112"">The majority of the High Court (Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s 51(xxiiiA).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s113"">29 Latham CJ emphasised, at 243, that the power given to the Commonwealth under s 51(xxiiiA) is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services, the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing 'position in the community', that is, a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth, when providing benefits out of public moneys, to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">30 The Chief Justice also said (at 249) that the term 'civil conscription' is wider than 'industrial conscription' and is applicable to ""any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation, perform particular work, or perform work in a particular way.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">"" The Chief Justice emphasised that the words 'any form of' in s 51(xxiiiA) evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be 'completely voluntary'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">Considering s 7A, his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list, the doctor is not given any live option.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting (at 253):",Statement
" 'There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way, and possibly in the only way, in which he is qualified to earn a living.</sentence>",Statement
Webb J expressed a similar view at 292-3.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">31 Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion; at 287.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">In his Honour's view, however, the fact that s 7A carried a penalty for non-compliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners, in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary, to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth, the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">Williams J summarised his view at 289:",Statement
" 'The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment, so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">...</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is super-imposed upon the contract of the parties.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written.</sentence>",Statement
32 The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at 294:,Statement
" 'To reiterate: if s 7A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form, which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both, would request a service which only a doctor can render, and which therefore is properly described as a medical service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">But when this service is made compulsory by a fine, or loss of practice to avoid the fine ...then, having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time, it becomes, I think, not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which, if not quite clear, was certainly intended to be comprehensive.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors.</sentence>",Statement
His Honour's comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">The General Practitioners case",Statement
33 The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of 'civil conscription' in any detail is the General Practitioners case .</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">Certain provisions of the HIA (ss 16A, 16B and 16C) and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services (other than prescribed pathology services) and also imposed obligations on some, at least, of the persons providing those services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an 'approved pathology practitioner'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">34 The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at 549:",Statement
"'First, it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">Secondly, it was said, the laws, by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way, compel them to carry on practice in a different way.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">... it was argued for the plaintiffs that few practitioners would be able to attract patients, or to make a living from their profession, if medical benefits were not payable in respect of their services, and that therefore, if ss 16A, 16B and 16C are valid, a practitioner who intends to render pathology services (whether as a specialist or as a general practitioner) is compelled by practical considerations to apply to become an approved pathology practitioner.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s144"">'",Statement
35 His Honour accepted that the facts in the case stated for the consideration of the High Court established that the provisions in question left some medical practitioners with no real choice if they wished to preserve their practices.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s145"">It would be necessary for them to become approved pathology practitioners, and for that purpose they would have to submit to the obligations imposed by the statute, the undertaking and the regulations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s146"">Referring to the BMA case, Gibbs J clearly stated, at 550:",Statement
"'The question whether a law imposes civil conscription cannot be answered in the negative simply because the law does not create any legal liability to perform any medical or dental service; the effect of the law in the economic and other circumstances must be considered, and practical compulsion is enough.</sentence>",Statement
"36 To answer the question it was necessary to examine the provisions of the Act, regulations and undertaking more closely.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s148"">His Honour noted first, at 554, that mere compulsion for a medical practitioner to seek to become an approved pathology practitioner could not in itself 'amount to the imposition of any form of civil conscription'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s149"">Accordingly, his Honour focussed in particular upon those provisions which had the effect of compelling medical practitioners to observe certain positive requirements.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s150"">Those provisions involved the requirement to make (or confirm) requests in writing, to give details of the relevant service in the handwriting of the person making the request and to record other particulars as required by the regulation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s151"">The approved pathology practitioner was also required to retain certain records for 18 months, to ensure that his employees acted in accordance with the legislation and to furnish information as required by the Minister from time to time.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s152"">In relation to these provisions his Honour said, at 559-60:",Statement
"'The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices, but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out, and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s153"">Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice, rather than to a medical service itself.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s154"">'",Statement
"37 Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case (Latham CJ at 249, Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294) to the effect that 'a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s155"">At 557, Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus:",Statement
"'That expression, ['any form of civil conscription'] used in its natural meaning, and applied, as the context of par.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s156"">(xxiiiA) requires, to medical and dental services, refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s157"">However, in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do, in a particular way, some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service, when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s158"">... it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s159"">...</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s160"">There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression ""any form of civil conscription"" where it appears s 51(xxiiiA) should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s161"">The words ""any form of"" do not, in my opinion, extend the meaning of ""conscription"", and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s162"">Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services, but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA) that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed, and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s163"">I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s164"">(xxiiiA) any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind, provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed.</sentence>",Statement
"38 Gibbs J added that he agreed with the opinion expressed in by Dixon J in the BMA case, that there is a wide distinction between regulating the manner in which an incident of medical practice is carried on (if and when it is done) and the compulsion to serve medically or to render medical services, the latter, but not the former, being within the prohibition.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s166"">39 Despite the disagreement outlined in the passage quoted above, Gibbs J did not regard the BMA case as wrongly decided as it could be supported on narrower grounds.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s167"">His Honour identified the fatal elements in the legislation considered in the BMA case as being:",Statement
 1. that s 7A required a doctor to write any prescriptions for any medicine included in the prescribed list on the form supplied by the Commonwealth irrespective of whether the medicines were to be obtained free.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s168"">This requirement had no necessary relationship with any pharmaceutical benefit or medical services provided by the Commonwealth; and 2. in the light of its history and context, s 7A could be seen to intend to compel medical practitioners to join the Commonwealth scheme for the provision of free pharmaceutical benefits and to provide 'against their will' a medical service for the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s169"">",Statement
40 Gibbs J felt that these elements sufficiently distinguished the position under s 7A from that under consideration in the General Practitioners case; see [36] above.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s170"">The only medical service that the provisions in question compelled was, possibly, that required by s 16A(1) of the HIA , namely that a request by medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render an approved pathology service should be made or confirmed in writing.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s171"">Although Gibbs J thought that such a request might be regarded as a medical service he held that the section did not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s172"">Rather it required that the request, if made , be in writing.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s173"">41 Subject to the points made below in [42]-[43], and to some additional observations that are not relevant here, the other members of the High Court agreed with Gibbs J that the provisions under consideration did not impose compulsion amounting to 'civil conscription'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s174"">42 Although it is clear that Gibbs J was of the opinion that practical compulsion, as distinct from legal compulsion, is sufficient to satisfy the concept of 'civil conscription', given the High Court's interpretation of the legislation under consideration in the General Practitioners case it was not necessary to decide this point.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s175"">Indeed, Barwick CJ, Mason J and Wilson J all left this question open.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s176"">Barwick CJ additionally commented that he did not read the decision of the majority in the BMA case as deciding the issue adding, at 537-8:",Statement
" 'But that is not to say that, in my opinion, civil conscription could not in any case result from the coercive force of circumstance: but, in my opinion, to make out such a case would need an extremely strong set of circumstances which, in real terms, left the individual with no choice but to submit to what the statute required, though it did not command it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s177"">'",Statement
"43 The other four members of the High Court accepted that practical compulsion was sufficient to breach the constitutional prohibition on civil conscription and clearly regarded the majority of the High Court in the BMA case as having decided the issue; per Gibbs J (with whom Stephen J agreed) at 550 and 556; per Murphy J at 565, per Aickin J at 565.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s178"">44 In summary, the General Practitioners case decided there was no compulsion (legal or otherwise) to provide medical services amounting to any form of civil conscription because:",Statement

 Interpretation of Part VAA,Statement
"45 I have gone into considerable detail in analysing the General Practitioners case because, in my view, the principles for which it stands apply to the present circumstances and inexorably lead to the conclusion that Part VAA of the HIA does not provide for any form of civil conscription.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s180"">The General Practitioners case clearly shows, however, that careful examination of the specific requirements of challenged legislation is crucial to the determination of whether the constitutional prohibition has been breached.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s181"">46 The salient features of the Medicare Scheme and the PSR Scheme are outlined in [5] --- [13] above.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s182"">As can be seen, there is no legal compulsion for a medical practitioner to participate in the Medicare Scheme any more than there was for medical practitioners to become approved pathology providers under the legislation considered in the General Practitioners case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s183"">I accept that here, as there in the General Practitioners case, there is a form of compulsion in that it may be severely detrimental, if not fatal, to the viability of a medical practice if the practitioner were excluded from the Medicare Scheme.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s184"">The General Practitioners case clearly establishes, however, that such compulsion is neither a legal nor a practical compulsion to provide a medical service and is not affected by the constitutional prohibition; see [36] above.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s185"">It is not clear exactly what the High Court meant by 'practical compulsion' but the acceptance ('with equanimity' as Mr Robertson observed) in the General Practitioners case of the fact that a pathologist who did not participate in the statutory scheme under consideration might not have a viable practice shows that such compulsion as is here involved, does not fall within the constitutional prohibition; see the General Practitioners Case at 549-50 per Gibbs J.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s186"">It may be that 'practical compulsion' is a term that follows from an examination of the substance of a statute rather than mere form and is really a conclusion about that which offends the constitutional prohibition.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s187"">In any event I do not need to decide that here.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s188"">47 For the applicant to succeed he would have to show that important aspects of rendering medical services are compulsory under the Medicare Scheme, enforced by the PSR Scheme.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s189"">In making this point Mr Robertson referred to the provision for assignment of benefits under the Medicare Scheme to the medical practitioner who provides the service; see [5]-[6] above.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s190"">In support of his submission that a medical practitioner was entirely free to accept payment by way of assignment of the benefit he referred to the comments to this effect in Health Insurance Commission v Peverill [1994] HCA 8 ; (1994) 179 CLR 226 at 235 per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s191"">As Mr Robertson explained, a doctor can charge whatever fee he likes for his services; it is only where he voluntarily accepts assignment as full payment that his fee is limited to the amount that the Commonwealth is prepared to pay.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s192"">The fact that the practitioner may be financially advantaged in deciding to accept an assignment does not make the provision compulsory.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s193"">48 As explained at [7] --- [18] above, the PSR Scheme provides for a practitioner's conduct to be examined to determine if he or she has engaged in 'inappropriate practice'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s194"">The consequences attached to a finding of inappropriate practice show that, as the name suggests, the purpose of the provisions is to prevent inappropriate practice rather than to compel the provision of medical services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s195"">Such a simple analysis is, of course, not sufficient to resolve the issues raised by the applicant but it does make clear that the thrust of the provisions is to regulate the conduct of medical practitioners, including the way in which they provide medical services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s196"">49 The applicant accepts that regulating the incidents of medical practice does not offend the constitutional prohibition but contends that the PSR Scheme does more than regulate the incidents of medical practice.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s197"">It does not merely regulate the number of services provided or the administrative incidents of medical practice but, it is submitted, the Scheme trespasses into the actual medical services provided not just the manner in which they are provided; it affects the practitioner's clinical decision whether or not to provide a particular service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s198"">This feature alone, the applicant contends, distinguishes the present-day system from that considered by the High Court in the General Practitioners case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s199"">50 In my view this submission does not take sufficient account of Gibbs J's express statement in the General Practitioner's case (see [37] above) that Parliament has the power to make laws as to the manner in which medical services are performed where such laws are 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the Commonwealth's power to provide medical and dental services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s200"">It is incidental to the exercise of the power to provide medical services to be able to make such regulatory laws and to be able to annex conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided, even if this means that medical or dental services have to be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s201"">The making of such laws is not civil conscription provided that 'no compulsion to serve is imposed'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s202"">Therefore the issue here is whether regulation with reference to the criterion of 'inappropriate practice' is 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s203"">51 The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power, whether arising by implication or expressly under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution , it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or, as Rich J said, not to put the cart before the horse; Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533 at 563.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s204"">The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s205"">The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s 81 of the Constitution .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s206"">Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s 81 authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction, the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s207"">His Honour, at 270, put the point thus:",Statement
 ' [T] he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan; the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money.</sentence>,Statement
"52 Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, s 51(xxiiiA) has, of course, authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s209"">However, as the General Practitioners case shows, the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s210"">53 The applicant accepts that matters 'merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine' do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealth's administration of its benefits scheme.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s211"">In the applicant's written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s212"">The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealth's provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s213"">54 The applicant is correct that the regulation implicit in the concept of inappropriate practice is capable of going to the heart of medical services rather than merely to ancillary aspects.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s214"">Whether that is different from merely regulating the incidents of medical services I do not need to decide, although I suspect that it is not.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s215"">Ultimately however, I do not accept that a constitutional provision that empowers the Commonwealth to provide medical services, including through the existing network of medical practitioners, at the same time prohibits it from imposing standards on the medical services provided.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s216"">Such standards are integral to the responsible provision of medical services and, as Latham CJ recognised in the BMA case, the Commonwealth's incidental power entitles it to provide for such matters as well as to take the necessary precautions to ensure that public money is properly used; see [29] above.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s217"">A disciplinary system that is directed to support such precautions (as opposed to a free-standing disciplinary system) would also fall within the incidental power of the Commonwealth even if it could otherwise be viewed as exceeding the power of the Commonwealth because it can be characterised as, for example, a law with respect to the regulation of medical practice.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s218"">As the High Court observed in Alexandra Private Geriatric Hospital Proprietary Limitetd v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 6 ; (1987) 162 CLR 271 at 279:",Statement

55 The applicant contends that the concept of inappropriate practice could be anything that a Committee considers it to be; that it could extend to any conduct of the practitioner.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s220"">This submission cannot be sustained.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s221"">Section 80(1) shows that 'inappropriate practice' is a subset of a person's conduct; it refers to examining a person's conduct to ascertain if there has been 'inappropriate practice'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s222"">Inappropriate practice is defined in s 82 (see [8] above).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s223"">The definition restricts the concept to conduct 'in connection with rendering or initiating [medical] services' and provides that it must be such that the Committee could 'reasonably conclude' that the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s224"">The context indicates that the grounds on which the conduct is to be judged must relate to the services that are rendered or initiated.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s225"">Moreover, the Explanatory Memorandum quoted above at [15] indicates that the relevant conduct is conduct in the course of the practice of medicine.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s226"">Were a Committee to attempt to label as 'inappropriate practice' conduct of a medical practitioner that is unrelated to the provision of medical services the appropriate challenge would be, not to the constitutional validity of the PSR, but to the accuracy of the committee's interpretation of the concept.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s227"">56 This point was made in Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453 at 459 where Davies J observed that, notwithstanding the width of the definition of 'inappropriate conduct', it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed:",Statement
 'The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s228"">Therefore, under Pt VAA, the power to discipline in relation to ""inappropriate practice"" must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s229"">Accordingly, the reference to ""inappropriate practice"" in s 82 refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s230"">The Commonwealth's interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill, that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s239"">The only possible exception is s 16A (1), which requires that a request by a medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render a pathology service shall be made or confirmed in writing as prescribed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s240"">A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s241"">However, s 16A(1) does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s242"">What it requires is that the request, if made, be made or confirmed by written instrument which satisfies reg.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s243"">5.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s244"">There is nothing in that regulation which affects in the slightest the performance by a medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s245"">The statutory requirements may impose on him more administrative work.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s246"">In particular he is required to specify, in his own handwriting, the services to which the instrument relates, and cannot simply mark a form on which is printed a list of possible services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s247"">The reason why a condition of this kind is attached to the entitlement to medical benefits is no doubt that the use of the printed form might reasonably be regarded as likely to contribute to laxity and to facilitate fraud.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s248"">However that may be, to require a practitioner to write out particulars of the service which he has decided to request another practitioner to perform is not to compel the practitioner making the request to perform a medical service.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s249"">Even more clearly, the requirements of s 16A(2) with regard to accounts and receipts, and those of s 16A(3) with regard to the retention and production of any written request or confirmation, do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical service.</sentence>",Statement

59 I have quoted his Honour's comments at length to make quite clear his Honour's position.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s252"">His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because, put simply, that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself; although it may have been incidental to a medical service; and where a medical service was regulated, as by requiring a request to be made in writing, the medical service itself was not compelled.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s253"">These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s254"">60 In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s255"">For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s256"">The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s257"">The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealth's power under s 51(xxiiiA) to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s258"">In my view a proper application of the term 'inappropriate practice' would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s259"">61 For the above reasons the applicant's challenge to the constitutional validity of PSR Scheme must fail.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s12"">The EBA was made pursuant to s 170LJ of the WR Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s13"">Although its nominal expiry date was 30 June 2003, the effect of s 170LX is that it continues to govern the terms and conditions of the employment of relevant employees of UB, other than those employees who have subsequently entered into an operative AWA with UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s14"">8 Between June 2003 and late 2005, various efforts were made by the NTEU and/or UB to introduce a new agreement that would govern the terms and conditions of employment at UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s15"">Initially, the NTEU unsuccessfully sought to negotiate an agreement pursuant to s 170LJ.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s16"">Subsequently, UB made two unsuccessful attempts to make an agreement directly with its academic and general employees pursuant to s 170LK.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s17"">The first of these proposed s 170LK agreements went to a ballot of staff members between 17 and 21 October 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s18"">The ballot rejected the proposed agreement, with 451 staff members voting against the agreement and 335 for it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s19"">The second proposed agreement went to a ballot of staff members between 22 and 23 November 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s20"">Again, the ballot resulted in a rejection of the agreement, with 401 staff members voting against it and 323 voting in favour of it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s21"">In connection with these two ballots, the NTEU and UB distributed a considerable amount of information and other material to affected staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s22"">This material drew attention to differences that existed between the proposed s 170LK agreements and the provisions of the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s23"">9 After the failure of the second ballot, UB commenced offering AWAs to its staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s24"">The AWAs were, broadly speaking, modelled on the agreements which had been rejected by the ballots.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s25"">THE ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS",Statement
"<sentence id=""s68"">12 The applicant alleges that the statements which appear under Question 1 and Question 3 are false and misleading, and contravene s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s69"">The essence of the complaint is that, in respect of important employment issues, namely redundancy, probationary employment, termination and discipline and dispute settling procedures, there are significant differences between the terms and conditions in the proposed AWA when compared with the prevailing terms and conditions in the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s70"">I shall not attempt to detail the material differences between the two sets of terms and conditions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">They are helpfully summarised in the applicant's outline of written submissions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">It is unnecessary to set out the detailed differences because UB concedes that there are differences and that the differences are not insignificant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">13 The applicant contends that the statement which appears in the December 2005 email under Question 1 is false and misleading because the significant differences that do exist make it clear that staff members will in fact lose 'key employment conditions' under the AWA which they would otherwise be entitled to under the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74"">Further, he contends that the significant differences that exist between the two sets of conditions also make it clear that 'important employment conditions' in the EBA have been changed by the proposed AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">UB acknowledges that changes have been made, but disputes the proposition that the changes involve the loss of key employment conditions or a change in important employment conditions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">14 In relation to what appears under Question 3, the applicant submits that the December 2005 email conveys to academic and general staff that the terms of the AWAs being offered by UB have no impact or bearing on the security of employment of staff members who sign the AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">The applicant submits that this representation is false and misleading, as the proposed AWAs will substantially diminish a number of EBA protections for employees in respect of how termination of employment or discipline may be affected.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">In short, the allegation is that the AWAs will make it easier for UB to terminate or discipline academic and general staff, thereby adversely affecting their security of employment.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">It is put that provisions in an industrial instrument which go to the method of termination of employment directly concern security of employment: see Re Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia; Ex parte Wooldumpers (Victoria) Limited [1989] HCA 10 ; (1989) 166 CLR 311 at 336 per Gaudron J.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s80"">15 Section 170WG(2) is concerned with 'knowingly' false or misleading statements.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s81"">The applicant submits that this element of the alleged contraventions will be made out because Mr Walker was directly responsible for the negotiation of the EBA, and also had the conduct of the later unsuccessful attempts to introduce a replacement agreement on behalf of UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s82"">As a result, Mr Walker had very detailed knowledge of the terms of the EBA, and the respects in which they differed from the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">In these circumstances, the applicant submits that there is a serious question to be tried that Mr Walker knew all of the essential matters which would go to make up the alleged contravention of s 170WG(2), whether or not Mr Walker perceived that the statements in the December 2005 email were false or misleading: see Yorke v Lucas (1985) 159 CLR 661 at 669 per Gibbs CJ; and King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd (2001) 184 ALR 98 at 104-106.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s84"">16 The applicant contends that the December 2005 statements amounted to continuing representations, which may influence staff members who are contemplating the making of an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s85"">Without conceding that there was anything false, misleading or inaccurate about the December 2005 statements, UB disputed the ongoing influence of those statements.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s86"">UB relies upon an affidavit sworn by Mr Walker on 22 February 2006 which points out that a significant amount of additional information has been provided to staff members since 14 December 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s87"">17 On 27 January 2006, UB modified the information on its web page concerning the AWAs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s88"">In particular, the section headed 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' was amended to include, inter alia , the following statements:",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">In contrast, the December 2005 statements were sent by email to all staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">19 Mr Walker deposes that information sessions concerning the proposed AWAs were held with academic and general staff in late December 2005 and in January and February 2006.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">At these sessions, Mr Walker says that he explained the workplace disputes clause and the differences between the procedure put in place by the AWA when compared with the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">In addition, Mr Walker deposes that if any staff member was misled by the December 2005 email, then the information sessions conducted by UB and the changes to the 'AWAs: Frequently Asked Questions' web page would have made clear to them that a number of conditions of employment, including those relating to managing under-performance, discipline for misconduct and serious misconduct, redundancy and the resolution of workplace disputes would be altered by the AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">20 UB also relied upon an affidavit by Ms Penelope Faith Irish, a manager employed by UB in the area of accommodation services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">She deposes that she signed an AWA after attending an information session with Mr Walker.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">She refers to differences between the EBA and the AWA in the area of redundancy entitlements, redundancy review processes, dispute resolution processes and the process to manage unsatisfactory performance and allegations of misconduct, but considered those issues to be peripheral and not important to her personally compared with other matters covered by the AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s121"">21 UB also relies upon the fact that since 14 December 2005, the NTEU has provided extensive information to staff members drawing their attention to differences between the proposed AWAs and the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">In his submissions, Dr Jessup QC, senior counsel for UB, recognised that information published by the NTEU may not have the same authority or significance as correcting information that is published by UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS",Statement
22 The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours of the grant of an injunction: see Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Limited [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618; American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396; Australian Coarse Grain Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board of Queensland (1983) 57 ALJR 425; Tableland Peanuts Pty Ltd v The Peanut Marketing Board (1984) 58 ALJR 283; Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (1984) 3 FCR 55; and Patrick Stevedores Operations (No 2) Proprietary Limited v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 ("" Patrick Stevedores "").</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience: see Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 at 472.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">23 The High Court has recently stressed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 ("" ABC "") that an interlocutory injunction is granted in aid of some legal or equitable right to final relief: see Gleeson CJ at 217 [11]-[12] and 218 [16]; Gaudron J at 232 [60]; and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 240-241 [88]-[91] and 248 [105].</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">Gummow and Hayne JJ said that the basic proposition where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought is that it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature (at 241 [91]).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">I leave aside for the moment, as the High Court did, cases where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in some special statutory jurisdiction, and cases where the integrity of the judicial process is protected by forms of relief such as the Mareva order or anti-suit injunctions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">24 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217 [12]).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s131"">This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">25 The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Limited v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s134"">But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">26 One final and perhaps obvious point that bears repeating is that the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">Ordinarily, the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself as to whether there is a serious question to be tried, or about other matters that may bear on the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED",Statement
"27 On the material before me, I have concluded that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the December 2005 email contained statements which were knowingly false or misleading, and which were made to staff members of UB with the intention of persuading them to make an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the significant differences that exist between the EBA and the proposed AWAs, and evidence indicating that Mr Walker has a detailed knowledge of both instruments.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">28 This conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry, as UB challenges the applicant's legal entitlement to relief on other grounds.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant has not established that the interim relief he seeks is properly connected with any final relief to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">In this context, Dr Jessup relies upon the width of the claims for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">Despite criticism of the terms of relief, the applicant did not seek to narrow the form of the interlocutory injunctions it seeks.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">As to the first order, Dr Jessup submitted that s 170WG(2) would not support an interim injunction restraining UB from taking any further step to enter into an AWA with a group member.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s144"">This form of relief, he said, was not directed at restraining the making of, or containing or ameliorating the consequences of, allegedly misleading statements, and would go beyond the relief that could be granted at final trial.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s145"">Dr Jessup criticised the second order on the grounds that it was expressed in broad and sweeping terms, and no Court would issue a restraining order in terms that UB must refrain from making false or misleading statements to group members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s146"">Such an order would do no more than replicate the general terms of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s147"">Dr Jessup criticised the third injunctive order that was sought on the ground that a mandatory order requiring UB to correct the false or misleading statements in the December 2005 email would prejudge the outcome of the case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s148"">In my view, there is some force in these criticisms.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s149"">29 Next, Dr Jessup submitted that the applicant cannot seek an interim order preventing UB from making an AWA with him in circumstances where the applicant asserts that he has not been misled and will not in any event make an AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s150"">In Dr Jessup's submission, the applicant is not seeking an interlocutory remedy for himself, but is trying to do so for other members of the group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s151"">For those members of the group who have already made an AWA, and for those like the applicant who do not intend to make an AWA, it is difficult to say that the interlocutory relief that is being sought is in aid of final relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s152"">The form of relief that is sought is arguably relevant only to those members of the group who have not yet made an AWA, but who may wish to do so.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s153"">30 An applicant in a representative proceeding must himself or herself have standing to sue a particular respondent: see Symington v Hoechst Schering Agrevo Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 164.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s154"">There is no doubt that the question whether conduct challenged under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was misleading or deceptive can warrant determination on a representative basis, notwithstanding the fact that inducement might be an element of each individuals cause of action: see King v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [2000] FCA 1543 at [13] - [14] .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s155"">The applicant submitted that a representative action can be brought seeking final declarations and final injunctions in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s156"">31 In Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 202 ; (2000) 97 FCR 186, the Full Court (comprised of Ryan, Lee and Branson JJ) considered objections to standing in respect of a proceeding that alleged contravention of s 170WG(1) of the WR Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s157"">The proceeding in question was a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s158"">The Full Court rejected an argument that a penalty could not be imposed under s 170VV in respect of a contravention of s 170WG(1) unless the conduct constituting the duress brought about the making of an AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s159"">The Full Court said that such a construction should be rejected because it would allow even the most reprehensible conduct engaged in by a party in relation to a proposed AWA to go unexamined by a Court if no concluded agreement were to come into existence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s160"">On its proper construction the WR Act supported a wider availability of the remedy afforded by s 170VV.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s161"">In addressing this issue, the Full Court also considered whether the trial judge, Moore J, had erred in adding an individual, Mr James Burns, as an additional applicant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s162"">The alleged error was said to have arisen because Mr Burns had declined the offer of employment and so had never become a party to an AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s163"">The Full Court construed the reference in s 170VV(3) to 'a party to the AWA or ancillary document' so as to include a party to negotiations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s164"">32 It follows therefore that an action for penalties and injunctive relied under ss 170VV and 170VZ can properly be constituted as a representative action: see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 1250 ; (1999) 94 FCR 179.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s165"">I also note that s 33C of the FCA Act provides that a representative proceeding may be commenced whether or not the relief sought is the same for each person represented.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s166"">And I entirely accept the proposition that nothing in s 170VZ excludes this Court's powers under s 23 of the FCA Act to grant an interim or interlocutory injunction in an appropriate case: see Patrick Stevedores at 29 [27] per Brennan CJ; and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 at 103 [96] .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s167"">Nonetheless, it may be a different question whether an applicant can bring an application for interlocutory relief in a representative proceeding, where the applicant has no individual entitlement to that relief, but the relief is sought on the basis that it may be relevant and necessary for other members of the group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s168"">33 Dr Jessup's submissions may also raise issues about the identification of the group members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s169"">In this case, the application alleges that a common issue of law and fact arises, namely whether the December 2005 statements made on behalf of UB were knowingly false or misleading with the intention of persuading the academic and general staff to make the AWA, within the meaning of s 170WG(2) of the WR Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s170"">In respect of these issues, the group may be composed of three different classes of members: first, those like the applicant, who have not signed the AWA and do not intend to do so; second, those who have not signed the AWA and who may wish to do so; and third those who have signed the AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s171"">The affected groups or sub-groups may need to be defined more precisely: ss 33Q and 33ZB of the FCA Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s172"">34 I have not had the benefit of full argument on any of the issues raised by these submissions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s173"">I do not propose to express from views about the submissions discussed in [28] to [29] above.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s174"">In all the circumstances, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to relief at trial.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s175"">In view of the matters relied upon by Dr Jessup, however, I consider that the case that has been demonstrated by the applicant at this stage is towards the weaker end of the spectrum.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s176"">As will appear it is unnecessary for me to be more definitive, as I have reached the conclusion that the application for interim relief should be refused on other grounds.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s177"">BREACH OF AN IMPLIED TERM OF TRUST AND CONVENIENCE",Statement
35 The applicant's outline of written submissions contains an allegation that an implied term of trust and confidence should be implied into each group member's contract of employment with UB: see generally Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144; Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; and Heptonstall v Gaskin (No 2) (2005) 138 IR 103.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s178"">The outline further alleges that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached this implied term by recklessly or knowingly making false or misleading statements to its staff members concerning the terms and conditions of employment which would apply to them if they entered into the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s179"">36 The application by which these proceedings was instituted does not contain any reference to these allegations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s180"">Nor is it mentioned in any of the affidavits that were filed by the applicant in support of its application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s181"">The first notice that UB had of these allegations came when the applicant's counsel handed up the outline of written submissions at the commencement of the interlocutory hearing.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s182"">In these circumstances, Dr Jessup said that he did not intend to address any submissions to these allegations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s183"">37 I am not satisfied at this stage that there is a serious question to be tried that UB breached any such implied contractual term.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s184"">The basic case that has been put is simply that Mr Walker made statements that were false and misleading in circumstances which gave rise to a contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s185"">38 In view of the lack of notice of these allegations to the respondent, and the lack of evidence directed to the breach of the alleged implied term, I do not propose to discuss these allegations any further.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s186"">I note as well that the applicant hardly addressed any submissions to the alleged breach of implied term.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s187"">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE",Statement
39 The grant of an interlocutory injunction is discretionary.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s188"">In exercising that discretion, the Court will closely examine the balance of convenience.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s189"">This involves weighing up the extent of any impending prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant if injunctive relief is not granted pending trial, and weighing that against the extent of any hardship that the grant of the injunction may cause the respondent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s190"">It also needs to be borne in mind that the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo, and that the interlocutory injunction is granted so as to preserve or protect the legal or equitable rights that are sought to be vindicated in the proceedings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s191"">One relevant inquiry for the Court will be whether irreparable injury which is not compensable in damages will result if relief is not granted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s192"">40 The applicant submits that irreparable harm will occur if injunctive relief is not granted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s193"">He submits that the Court is not empowered to revoke an AWA even if it is made in reliance on false or misleading statements made in contravention of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s194"">This is said to follow from the fact that an AWA, once filed, takes on a statutory character.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s195"">Section 170VM sets out the circumstances when an AWA may be terminated, and the applicant points out that none of them apply to the present circumstances.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s196"">Further, the applicant submits that the Court is not empowered to make an order for damages in respect of any loss suffered in consequence of a breach of s 170WG(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s197"">UB also submitted that the Court is not empowered to set aside an AWA after it has been filed, and takes on a statutory character.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s198"">41 The applicant's case for interlocutory relief was based on the premise that the December 2005 statements were continuing to operate, and might mislead staff members into making an AWA between the time of the hearing and the determination of the proceeding.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s199"">The interim relief is not relevant to those members of the group who have already made AWAs, or those members of the group who, like the applicant, possess full information and do not intend to make an AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s200"">42 In my opinion, the legitimate purpose of an interlocutory injunction at this point, pending trial, is to eliminate or mitigate the risk that staff members of UB might be misled by the December 2005 statements into making an AWA if no relief is granted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s201"">43 The starting point, therefore, is to consider what relief, if any, is just, convenient or necessary at this point to address the risk that the December 2005 statements are continuing to operate and may influence staff members to enter into an AWA with UB.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s203"">UB submits that the academic community at UB is generally well informed about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWAs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s204"">Moreover, UB submits that the December 2005 statements have been overtaken by a substantial amount of subsequent information.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s205"">While there is some force in these submissions, there must remain a risk that the December 2005 statements may have some ongoing influence on some staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s206"">45 UB has submitted that any case which might otherwise have existed for the grant of interim relief is met by UB's preparedness to offer an undertaking to the Court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s207"">A form of undertaking was provided to me during the course of the hearing.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s208"">In essence, the undertaking is to the effect that UB will make a further extensive clarification statement to all staff members identifying the differences between the proposed AWA and the EBA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s209"">Further, UB said that it would undertake to refrain from entering into AWAs with its staff members until the expiry of a period of seven days after the publication of the new information to its staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s210"">By this means, UB submitted that any risk that staff members might enter into an AWA on the basis of misleading or false statements would be removed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s211"">46 At the time of the hearing of the interlocutory application, the applicant and his counsel had not had a full opportunity of considering the terms of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s212"">I directed that the parties consult with each other about the terms of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s213"">I further directed that UB submit a final form of the proposed undertakings after a process of consultation had taken place.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s214"">UB has now submitted a final form of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s215"">I have been informed that the parties have agreed upon the terms of the clarification statement, but no agreement was reached about other aspects of the proposed undertakings.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s216"">I shall not set the proposed undertakings in these reasons, as they are recorded in the orders which I propose to make.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s217"">47 In my opinion, the undertakings proposed by UB are a complete answer to the application for interim relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s218"">The proposed undertakings remove any real risk that staff members will be induced to enter into AWAs between the date of my order and the date of trial as a result of the allegedly misleading statements that were made in December 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s219"">48 In the light of the undertakings proffered by UB, I consider that the hardship that would be occasioned by the grant of wide interlocutory injunctions of the kind sought by the applicant outweighs any prejudice or inconvenience to the applicant and other group members that would be occasioned by withholding relief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s220"">The undertakings afford the best means of preserving the status quo pending trial, and address the risk that the December 2005 statements may have a continuing influence on staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s221"">In short, the undertakings produce an outcome that is both just and convenient.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s222"">49 A number of other factors support the conclusion that it is neither just nor convenient to grant the interlocutory relief sought by the applicant.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s223"">Some of them are discretionary factors.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s224"">50 First, the relief sought by the applicant is cast in extremely wide terms and arguably goes beyond relief that could be legitimately sought in this proceeding.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s225"">51 Secondly, the relief sought by the applicant would seriously impinge upon the rights of third parties.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s226"">An injunction restraining UB from entering into an AWA with its staff members pending the trial of this action would seriously affect the rights of those staff members, including their entitlement to back-pay.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s227"">The applicant submits that the risk that such employees would lose their entitlement to back-pay if AWAs cannot be concluded by 31 March 2006 is an arbitrary limitation that was imposed by UB, and it can be varied at UB's discretion.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s228"">I will assume that this is so.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s229"">Nonetheless, it is relevant to the exercise of my discretion that the form of relief that has been sought will significantly affect the rights of other staff members.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s230"">Their rights will be affected if the injunction were to go, whether or not the employees have fully informed themselves about the differences between the EBA and the proposed AWA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s231"">Employees may be so affected even if they opt out of the represented group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s232"">If there is another alternative that protects staff members from the risk that they will be misled by the December 2005 statements, such as that offered by the undertakings, it is a relevant consideration that the more drastic alternative proposed by the applicant will affect the rights of third parties.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s233"">52 The applicant submits that the position of third parties will be protected by its undertaking as to damages.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s234"">The usual form of undertaking in this Court extends beyond the damages which may be suffered by the respondent consequent upon the interlocutory order, and includes damages that may be suffered by other persons.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s235"">In this case, the applicant has proffered his own undertaking jointly with an undertaking by the NTEU.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s236"">I accept that a joint undertaking as to damages by the applicant and the NTEU is one of substance.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s237"">However, I do not consider that the availability of the undertaking can justify the making of an interim order that will seriously affect third party rights, in circumstances where there is another alternative that is both just and convenient and which will not adversely affect third party rights.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s238"">53 In this case, I would not discount the significance of the impact on third party rights in the way that Finkelstein J did in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2000) 106 IR 139 at [57].</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s8"">Before its listing Colorado Group was a subsidiary of Venator Group, Inc (formerly known as Woolworth Corporation) a large and well-known New York corporation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s9"">Initially, Colorado Group did not carry on any trade in its own right.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s10"">Its principal businesses ""Williams the Shoemen"" and ""Mathers for Shoes"" (obviously footwear retailing businesses) were conducted through subsidiaries, the second applicant, Williams the Shoemen Pty Limited, and Mathers Shoes Pty Limited, respectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s11"">In 1991 the group was restructured and the footwear businesses transferred to Colorado Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s12"">3 At the present time Colorado Group (by which appellation I include Williams the Shoemen) operates in Australia a chain of retail stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s13"">It has 165 Williams the Shoemen stores, 96 Mathers for Shoes stores, 28 JAG stores (which sell men's and women's clothing and fashion accessories), 10 Diana Ferrari stores (which sell women's footwear and leather goods) and 82 Colorado stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s14"">The Colorado stores sell clothing, accessories and footwear.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s15"">Ms Hudson, the general manager of the Colorado division, said that when they were established, the idea was that Colorado stores would market their products with ""strong reference to [an] outdoors, rugged lifestyle"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s16"">Now, as a result of Ms Hudson's initiative, Colorado is a ""lifestyle"" brand, ""offering smart, casual, integrated looks that connote or evoke a quintessentially 'Australian casual' look and feel.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s17"">""",Statement
"4 It is necessary to know something about the history of the applicants and how they came to market goods bearing the mark ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s18"">In 1982 there were approximately 140 Williams the Shoemen stores around Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s19"">In addition to selling shoes another product sold in those stores was a style of backpack with the word ""Colorado"" embroidered on the front.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s20"">The word ""Colorado"" may have appeared in conjunction with a logo comprising a ""simple mountain motif"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s21"">The logo was certainly applied to backpacks from 1988.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s22"">The backpacks were sold for use predominantly by schoolchildren and hence marketed as a ""back to school"" product.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s23"">Although the backpacks were sold throughout Australia, the product was most successful in north Queensland.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s24"">5 Beginning in 1987 the Colorado mark was also applied to shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s25"">Mr Williams, who was with the Colorado Group during the 1980s, said that initially the word was used in conjunction with the ""simple mountain motif"": both marks appearing on the sock of the shoe.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s26"">The word also appeared by itself on the outside of the shoe near the heel.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s27"">6 In 1988 Mr Williams began working with others on the development of a three peaked mountain logo for use in conjunction with the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s28"">The logo took its final form by 1991.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s29"">Thereafter the mountain logo was displayed on ""Colorado"" shoes on the inner sole, the bottom of the sole and on the outside of the upper of the shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s30"">7 Although new to Australia in 1982, the Colorado mark was not a new mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s31"">Mr Williams described it as a ""generic name"" used by the parent company (Woolworths Corporation) on goods marketed in the United States.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s32"">In describing the mark as a ""generic name"" Mr Williams meant that it was an ""in-house"" brand name used by Woolworths as a trade mark for its own products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s33"">Footlocker and Lynx are examples of other ""generic names"" used by Woolworths Corporation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s34"">Goods bearing the Colorado mark (backpacks and shoes) were acquired for sale through the agency of Woolworths Overseas Corporation, which, I assume, was another Woolworths subsidiary.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s35"">That company arranged for the manufacture of merchandise bearing ""generic names"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s36"">Representatives of the Australian subsidiary, and presumably also of subsidiaries in other countries, visited WOC's offices where sample goods were available for inspection.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s37"">If a subsidiary wished to purchase any of those goods the order for their manufacture would be placed by WOC, which was also responsible for quality control and ensuring that the goods met the local company's specifications.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s38"">It is not clear when this arrangement came to an end for the Australian subsidiary, but most likely it lasted until shortly before the listing of Colorado Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s39"">8 The volume of Colorado backpacks sold through Williams the Shoemen stores was relatively modest.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s40"">On the other hand, some considerable success was being achieved with the sale of Colorado shoes through both Williams the Shoemen and Mathers stores, especially as the range available increased and the quality improved.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s41"">While detailed accounting records are no longer available it is estimated that in 1990 around $8 million worth of Colorado branded products was sold by the two stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s42"">9 The success of Colorado branded shoes led the then retail director, Mr Beagley, to come up with the idea of expanding the Colorado range to include clothing and accessories and establishing a chain of ""Colorado"" stores to sell those products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s43"">As a preliminary step an advertising agency was retained to work on the proposal with Mr Beagley.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s44"">Together they produced a report in late 1992.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s45"">The ""Key Research Findings"" in the report were:",Statement
" ""The store concept was wholeheartedly endorsed by both lower and middle-upper income groups.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s61"">""",Statement
11 In July 1992 the Woolworths Corporation resolved to go ahead with the proposal.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s62"">During the next 12 months Mr Beagley and others within the Colorado Group developed a range of products that were to be sold through the Colorado stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s63"">The products were clothing, footwear, accessories (including backpacks, socks, hats, underwear and shoe care items), leather and non-leather belts, bags and wallets.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s64"">12 Three Colorado stores were opened in July 1993.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s65"">One was located in Doncaster, Victoria, another in Parramatta, New South Wales and the third in Penrith, New South Wales.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s66"">A fourth store was opened in September 1993, in Darling Harbour, Sydney, New South Wales.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s67"">Each store was stocked with a full range of Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s68"">Some, such as bags, were marked with the Colorado mark alone while others were marked with both the Colorado mark and the mountain logo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s69"">Although the word Colorado was sometimes used in isolation, the predominant use of the word was in association with the mountain logo, particularly in relation to footwear, bags, handbags and other accessories.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s70"">During the next three years (1993 to 1996) six more Colorado stores were opened, three in New South Wales, two in Queensland and one in Victoria.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s71"">13 Initially the new venture was not profitable but this was not unexpected.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s72"">In 1997 or 1998 it was decided to change the ""image"" of the Colorado brand and expand the number of Colorado outlets.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s73"">Ms Hudson, at the time the general merchandise manager, was behind the move.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s74"">Her idea was to redefine the Colorado image to an ""Australian lifestyle"" brand.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s75"">Ms Hudson described this style as ""a lot cleaner and smarter"" than the previous ""outdoor"" image.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s76"">Under Ms Hudson's watch the number of Colorado stores expanded significantly and the range of Colorado branded products grew to encompass items such as watches and eyewear.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s77"">By this time the mark ""Colorado"" was used principally alone.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s78"">The result of the changes in style as well as a significant increase in advertising was that turnover improved dramatically.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s79"">14 It is now time to say something about the respondent, Strandbags Group Pty Limited.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s80"">The company was incorporated in New South Wales in 1983 and currently operates (in some cases through franchisees) a chain of 186 stores around Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s81"">It is a speciality retailer of bags, travel goods, backpacks, wallets and other small leather goods and accessories.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s82"">It has an extensive portfolio of registered trade marks, including a mark that incorporates the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s83"">Goods branded with the Colorado mark were originally put onto the market by Edgarlodge Pty Ltd, a company owned and controlled by Lee Evans and his wife.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s84"">Edgarlodge's business was established in the 1980s.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s85"">It sold bags, luggage, briefcases and accessories, initially under the business names ""The Travel Bug"" and ""Bagstop"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s86"">15 In the early years Edgarlodge obtained its stock from Australian importers and local manufacturers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s87"">In the latter part of the 1980s Mr Evans began to investigate the possibility of importing his own products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s88"">He also considered what brand name he should use for the imported goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s89"">He chose the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s90"">He says this was because he had been looking for something with an American influence and being a John Denver fan was fond of ""Colorado Rocky Mountain High"" describing it as ""one of [my] favourite songs"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s91"">""Colorado Rocky Mountain High"" is not the title of a Denver song, but is a recurring line in a song entitled ""Rocky Mountain High"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s92"">At all events, Mr Evans said that he decided to use the word ""Colorado"" in early 1990.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s93"">He also said that he was not aware of anyone else in Australia using that name.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s94"">Mr Evans conducted a search at the Trade Marks Office and the Australian Securities Commission to see if anyone had registered a mark or business name using the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s95"">The searches disclosed that ""Colorado"" was neither a registered business name nor a registered trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s96"">When it was discovered that the word was apparently available for use, Edgarlodge applied for and obtained registration of the business name ""Colorado Leathergoods"" on 30 May 1990.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s97"">16 I am very dubious about Mr Evans' evidence concerning his choice of the mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s98"">That he was a John Denver fan may be accepted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s99"">But I do not believe the rest of his story.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s100"">I suspect that Mr Evans had come across the name on goods (probably goods sold by one of the applicants) and wanted to use it but needed to check if anyone (perhaps one of the applicants) had rights in respect of it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s101"">17 Moving on, in early 1991 Mr Evans' secretary, Ms Priest, prepared a design for a logo to be used in conjunction with the word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s102"">The logo was the head of an American Indian.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s103"">In due course the word and logo mark was registered as a combination mark in respect of handbags, travelgoods and belts in class 18.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s104"">The products initially manufactured bearing the new mark (the word ""Colorado"" with the Indian head logo) were a range of handbags.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s105"">The mark was embossed on the front of each handbag.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s106"">Sales of the new line began in 1991 at Edgarlodge's then eleven Queensland stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s107"">In 1992 changes were effected to the style of the mark ""Colorado"" and to the Indian head and applied to the then existing range of over twenty-four styles of handbag.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s108"">The handbags proved to be popular so new products were added to the range, such as suitcases, wallets, key cases and coin purses.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s109"">As the range expanded to include other products, the combination mark was applied to them as well.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s110"">Between 1995 and 1998 the combination mark was applied to goods such as backpacks, briefcases and associated products as well as handbags.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s111"">Depending on the size of the product, the word and logo were either stamped on a leather patch and sewn onto the product or stamped directly onto the product.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s112"">As the range of goods continued to expand this practice varied.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s113"">For example, the word ""Colorado"" was stamped onto a gold metal tag and affixed to handbags, business bags and luggage.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">The word ""Colorado"" was also printed on business card inserts that were placed inside wallets.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">18 In August 1992 Edgarlodge opened a retail store in Liverpool, New South Wales.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">The store was designed as a ""Colorado theme store"" with the word ""Colorado"" in the shopfront design and on many Colorado products that were sold alongside other products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">The Liverpool store closed in April 1994.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">Mr Evans said that this was due to its poor location.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">At the same time there was a substantial increase in the volume and range of Colorado branded products sold by Edgarlodge at its other stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">These were products on which the combination mark or the Colorado mark alone was affixed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s121"">From 1995 to 1997 Edgarlodge opened fourteen stores that traded under the name ""The Colorado Bag Co"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">By this time, the Colorado side of Edgarlodge's business had become a sizable operation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">In the years 1997 and 1998 sales of Colorado branded products totalled $1.27 million and $2.08 million respectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">19 Strandbags Group came into the picture in September 1998 when it purchased from Edgarlodge the businesses conducted under the names ""The Travel Bug"", ""The Colorado Bag Co"" and ""Bagstop"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">Included among the assets purchased was the goodwill relating to the business carried on by Edgarlodge at its ""The Travel Bug"", ""The Colorado Bag Co"" and ""Bagstop"" outlets.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">In addition Strandbags Group also purchased from Edgarlodge several business names, including those just mentioned, together with a number of registered trade marks, including the Colorado with Indian head mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">20 Following the acquisition Strandbags Group decided to ""liquidate"" the stock it had just purchased, as well as stock that was currently on order by Edgarlodge and for which Strandbags Group had assumed responsibility.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">Included among the stock to be ""liquidated"" was all Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s129"">The intention was to replace this stock with stock manufactured by Strandbags Group's own suppliers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">There were two reasons.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s131"">First, Edgarlodge's computerised inventory system was not compatible with that of Strandbags Group and, second, it wished to produce a better quality product.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">It regarded itself as catering to ""the professional woman seeking a stylish, leather, functional [product]"" and who was shopping for the ""Australian casual"" look.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">21 The liquidation of the Colorado stock was completed by about March 1999.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s134"">Thereafter, apart from handbags, the stock was replaced by Strandbags Group's own lines of footwear, leathergoods (wallets and the like), backpacks, travel goods and business goods (mainly satchels) all marked ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">A range of Colorado branded handbags was designed and introduced in 2002.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">The range is now very extensive.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">Indeed, overall the categories of Colorado products sold by Strandbags Group are substantially larger than those that were supplied by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">22 Having provided a sketch of some of the more important facts, I can now deal with the claims.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">As I have said, Colorado Group's principal claim is for trade mark infringement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">By way of answer there is a substantial attack against the validity of the registration of the mark and a cancellation order is sought.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">It is, I think, convenient to deal with this aspect first.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">The application for cancellation is made under s 88.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">Two grounds are relied upon.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s144"">One relies on grounds upon which the registration of the mark could have been opposed (s 88(2)(a)).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s145"">Here it is said that Colorado Group was not the proprietor of the mark or, if it was the proprietor, the mark was not distinctive of its goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s146"">The other ground is that registration was obtained by false suggestion or misrepresentation (s 88(2)(e)).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s147"">23 I will look at proprietorship first.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s148"">In In re Hicks's Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636, Holroyd J said (at 639): ""A person cannot be properly registered [under the Trades Marks Act] unless he is the proprietor.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s149"">Proprietor is the person who at the moment he makes application to be registered is entitled to the exclusive use of the name, whether he then or before publicly adopted it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s150"">"" Broadly speaking, a person may be the proprietor of a mark in one of two ways.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s151"">First, in respect of a mark which has never been used the proprietor is the person who is (or claims through) the author of the mark (which could include the copyist of a foreign mark) and intends to use it: In re Hudson's Trade-Marks (1886) 32 Ch D 311, 319-320; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601, 627-628.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s152"">Second, a person may be the proprietor of a mark if he has used it, provided no-one else has used the mark before him.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s153"">This last proposition requires some elaboration.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s154"">In the case of an inherently distinctive mark nothing more than first use is necessary to establish proprietorship.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s155"">The applicant need not show that the mark has gained public recognition.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s156"">Any general use of the mark as a trade mark will be enough, although in a rare case the use may be so inconsequential that it should be ignored as de minimus.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s157"">Perhaps care should also be taken when there has been only a slight use of the mark followed by a long period of non-use, where something akin to the doctrine of abandonment might apply.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s158"">If a mark is not inherently distinctive but indicates that an article emanates from some (usually anonymous) source because, or partly because, the mark has acquired a secondary meaning, strictly speaking first use is not sufficient to establish proprietorship.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s159"">To make out proprietorship it is also necessary to show that the mark does in fact distinguish the applicant's goods from the goods of others.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s160"">Even if this is not an aspect of proprietorship (as I think it is), unless a secondary meaning is established s 41 would bar registration of the mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s161"">24 When considering proprietorship it is important to remember that there is no proprietorship in a mark per se.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s162"">Under the common law ""property in a trade-mark is ... the right to the exclusive use of some mark, name or symbol in connection with a particular manufacture or vendible commodity"": Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Couch Co Ltd (1863) 4 De G J &amp; S 137, 144.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s163"">See also Ainsworth v Walmsley (1866) 1 Eq 518, 524 (""This Court has taken upon itself to protect a man in the use of a certain trade-mark as applied to a particular description of article"").</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s164"">The position is no different under the Trade Marks Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s165"">The effect of the current statute, which is substantially similar to earlier legislation, is that a trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or services specified in Schedule 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 (Cth): Trade Marks Act , ss 19 , 27 in combination with Trade Mark Regulations, reg 3.1, 4.4, Sch 1.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s166"">25 It follows that proprietorship by first use is proprietorship in relation to the goods or classes of goods on which the mark has been used.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s167"">The proprietor is entitled to have his mark registered in respect of those goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s168"">This entitlement is not confined to identical goods or classes of goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s169"">Registration may also be obtained for goods or classes of goods which is or are ""a thing [or things] of the same kind"" ( Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 160, 178) or ""like articles of production"" ( Columbia Mill Company v Alcorn , 150 US 460, 464 (1893)) or ""articles of merchandise of the same kind"" ( Colman v Crump , 70 NY 573, 578 (1877)) or ""kindred articles"" ( The Collins Co v Oliver Ames &amp; Sons Corporation , 18 F 561, 570 (1882)), if there be any difference between these expressions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s170"">See also Edwards v Dennis (1885) 30 Ch D 454.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s171"">26 With this background in mind the first question to be resolved on proprietorship is whether as at 16 February 2001, Colorado Group was the proprietor of the mark ""Colorado"" in respect of backpacks, bags, wallets, purses and belts and for services in respect of those articles.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s172"">In looking at this question I will assume for the time being, though it is a matter in dispute, that the mark was capable of being distinctive of Colorado Group's goods and services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s173"">The answer to the first question requires consideration of three issues, viz (1) Was Colorado Group or its predecessor the first user of the Colorado mark on a backpack, being the article in respect of which first use is claimed?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s174"">(For this purpose it is conceded that Williams the Shoemen was the predecessor of Colorado Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s175"">It is also conceded that Williams the Shoemen was the first user of the word ""Colorado"" in combination with the ""simple mountain motif""); (2) If the word was applied to backpacks not alone but in combination with the ""simple mountain motif"" can Colorado Group (or its predecessor) nevertheless claim to be the first user of the Colorado mark?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s176"">; (3) If Colorado Group (or its predecessor) was the first user of the Colorado mark on backpacks, is a bag, wallet, purse or belt the same kind of article?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s177"">Unless each pair of questions (1) and (3), or (2) and (3), are answered affirmatively, the registration has gone too far and either Colorado Group is not the proprietor of the Colorado mark or is not the proprietor in respect of bags, wallets, purses and belts.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s178"">It may be that Edgarlodge first used the word ""Colorado"" on those goods, albeit in combination with the Indian head logo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s179"">27 Before I answer the question -- Is Colorado Group or its predecessor the proprietor of the Colorado mark by first use?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s180"">-- it is necessary to get out of the way two preliminary points.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s181"">The first is this.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s182"">It was suggested (perhaps only faintly) that when Williams the Shoemen and Colorado Group used the word ""Colorado"" on shoes and backpacks it was not use as a trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s183"">To determine whether this submission is correct I will proceed on the basis that if the word was used in a manner that would be understood by the public to indicate that the goods came from a definite or particular source, or that they emanated from the same, albeit anonymous, source as certain other goods, that is use as a trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s184"">It is quite clear that the word ""Colorado"" appearing on backpacks with or without the ""simple mountain motif"" was used to distinguish those goods as having a particular origin: that is, it was used as a trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s185"">It served no other function on the backpacks.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s186"">The use of the mark on shoes presents some difficulty.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s187"">One can readily imagine a designation, especially a word, applied to an article that comes in several styles, being used to distinguish the style and no more.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s188"">Here, the photographs depicting the boxes in which the shoes were packed shows quite clearly a trade mark use.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s189"">In any event I think this conclusion is inevitable in the case of the combination mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s190"">28 The second preliminary point is whether the mark ""Colorado"" was used as a trade mark by Colorado Group or by Woolworths Corporation, the United States parent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s191"">In support of a submission that the use was by Woolworths Corporation alone, Strandbags Group relies on a passage from Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd [1966] HCA 81 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254, 271:",Statement
" ""[W]e have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country, by means of sales to Australian retail houses, goods bearing his mark and the goods, bearing his mark, are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country, the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s192"">Indeed, in this case, the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re-sale does not, in any relevant sense, use it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s193"">""",Statement
29 In my opinion that case does not support the argument.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s194"">In the first place Estex established only that when a foreign owner of an Australian trade mark sells imported goods bearing the mark and the goods are then sold in Australia the foreign owner uses the mark in Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s195"">The case did not consider whether the local retailer also used the mark: Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670, 688.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s196"">In the second place there is little similarity between the facts of this case and those in Estex .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s197"">Woolworths Corporation was not a foreign manufacturer of goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s198"">It was not the owner of an Australian trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s199"">It did not sell goods bearing the Colorado mark for delivery in Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s200"">What we have here is a local retailer which, through the agency of a related company, arranged for goods to be manufactured overseas bearing a mark nominated by the local retailer and then imported the goods for retail sale.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s201"">The only involvement of Woolworths Corporation is that it authorised its local subsidiary to use one of its in-house marks.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s202"">It no doubt permitted other subsidiaries to use those marks in other jurisdictions.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s203"">However that may be, merely authorising a person to use a mark in Australia is not use in Australia by the person giving the authority.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s204"">It is clear in my view that only Colorado Group used the mark in Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s205"">30 Having got these preliminary points out of the way, I can now return to the first question.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s206"">As I have said, it is not in dispute that Colorado Group used the word ""Colorado"" in combination with the ""simple mountain motif"" on backpacks and shoes before the word ""Colorado"" was used by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s207"">Speaking generally, however, a person who is the proprietor of a combination mark is not the proprietor for trade mark purposes of the marks comprising each separate component: In re J B Palmer's Trade-Mark (1883) 24 Ch D 504; In re Royal Baking Powder Co [1880] WN 49; Richards v Butcher [1891] 2 Ch 522.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s208"">But there may be exceptions to the general rule.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s209"">In BP plc v Woolworths Ltd (2004) 62 IPR 545 I was required to consider whether it was possible to dissect a mark that was made up of several components and obtain trade mark registration of only one component.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s210"">I said (at 567-568) that it could be done, provided the component for which registration is sought ""creates an impression which is totally separate from the other[s] and is distinctive, that is it performs the trade mark function of identifying the source of the goods and services to customers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s211"">"" While I have heard no evidence on the point, my impression here is that each component (or at least the word) serves that function.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s212"">On this basis, then, Colorado Group could be regarded as the first user of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s213"">31 There is another basis for this conclusion.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s214"">As regards backpacks (being the only article in respect of which there is a possibility of establishing first use of the word mark) I agree with Mr Ryan that it is unclear whether the word ""Colorado"" was accompanied by the logo, at least in the early years.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s215"">There were only two witnesses called who were with Williams the Shoemen in 1982 and onwards, Mr Williams and Mr Ainsworth.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s216"">In his affidavit Mr Williams said that the backpacks were packaged in a cellophane bag which bore the printed word ""Colorado"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s217"">He also said the word ""Colorado"" was embroidered on the front of the backpack without the ""simple mountain motif"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s218"">In oral evidence he said he was ""sure that there was [the mark] across the top flap of the backpack.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s219"">A recollection of the logo I cannot recollect.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s220"">"" When pressed he said: ""[I] couldn't rule it [the mountain logo] out.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s221"">"" Mr Ainsworth's recollection went back only to the mid-1980s.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s222"">He said that at that time the mark on the backpacks comprised the word ""Colorado"" and the mountain logo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s223"">Given this state of the evidence it is not possible to reach any conclusion about the nature of the mark on backpacks between 1982 and, say, 1985.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s224"">In particular, one cannot say with any confidence that the mark comprised both the word and logo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s225"">This conclusion is necessarily adverse to Strandbags Group which carries the onus on the cross-claim.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s226"">32 On the last of the three questions -- Are bags, wallets, purses and belts the ""same kind"" of goods as a backpack?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s227"">-- the answer in my view is in the negative.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s228"">First it must be recalled that the style of backpack in respect of which the mark was used (and in respect of which it could be registered) was designed and promoted principally for use by schoolchildren for carrying stationery, books and other school items.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s229"">There are other styles of backpack, for example fashion backpacks or those used for mountain-climbing and hiking, but they are not the type with which the comparison must be made.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s230"">Broadly speaking, a ""bag"" is a receptacle made of some flexible material closed in on all sides except at the top: see Oxford English Dictionary vol 1 (2 nd ed, 1989) 880.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s231"">There are, however, many different types of bags.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s232"">They are as varied as plastic bags, bodybags, laundry bags etc.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s233"">Thus, not every bag can be the ""same kind of thing"" as a schoolboy's backpack.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s234"">In particular, a schoolboy's backpack is not akin to a ladies handbag.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s235"">Those are usually intended as a fashion item for the female consumer (albeit for an everyday use).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s236"">Articles such as wallets, purses and belts are even more dissimilar to the schoolboy's backpack given their respective, and different, uses.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s237"">This is not a case where the proprietor of a mark which has been applied to different kinds of articles that fall within a class or category of goods seeks to register that mark in respect of other articles within the class or category.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s238"">Such a proprietor would be entitled to register his mark not only for each article in the class to which the mark has been applied but also for such other articles in the class which a consumer would reasonably believe are likely to originate from the same source.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s239"">33 The next ground of attack against the registration of the trade mark is that it was not distinctive of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s240"">The point arises in the following way.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s241"">Generally, a word, name or device (or any other designation that may be a ""sign"" for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act ) can only be distinctive of a person's goods or services if it is ""inherently adapted to distinguish"" those goods or services or, if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has become distinctive by use, that is if it has acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s242"">A designation that is merely descriptive of the character of the goods or of their geographic origin or location cannot be inherently distinctive.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s243"">At least in the case of a geographic description ""there is necessarily great difficulty in proving that by reason of use or other circumstances [the designation] does in fact distinguish his goods"": Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks [1964] HCA 55 ; (1964) 111 CLR 511, 515 per Kitto J in an oft quoted passage.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s244"">34 As a matter of principle, the ""great difficulty"" that confronts an applicant who seeks to register a descriptive mark, especially a mark that describes the location or origin of goods, should be found to exist only in the case of a term that has that effect in relation to the specific goods for which registration is sought.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s245"">As regards a geographic term, in my opinion the comment on Subdivision (a) of SS720 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts, vol III (1938) correctly states the position.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s246"">The comment reads:",Statement
" ""The reasons for the rule that geographical names cannot be trademarks do not weigh heavily when the geographical name has obviously only an arbitrary or fanciful significance in connection with the goods upon which it is used.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s247"">Thus Gibraltar may be a trade-mark for automobiles since there is no likelihood that such use of the name would lead purchasers to suppose that there is any particular relation between the automobiles and the geographical locations known by that name, or any likelihood that it would seriously interfere with the freedom of merchants at Gibraltar to use that name.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s248"">Again, Ethiopian may be a proper trade-mark for ladies' stockings; for, while suggestive of a certain color and sheen, it is only fancifully so and there is no likelihood that other merchants may have occasion properly to use the name Ethiopia on stockings since there is no factor of importance associating stockings with Ethiopia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s249"">Such is also the case of Pacific for bread or Arctic for refrigerators.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s250"">""",Statement
"Reference should also be made to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co v Wolf Brothers &amp; Co , 240 US 251 (1916).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s251"">The case concerned a trade mark consisting of the words ""The American Girl"" as applied to women's shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s252"">The Supreme Court said of this mark (at 256-257): ""We do not regard the words 'The American Girl,' adopted and employed by complainant in connection with shoes of its manufacture, as being a geographical or descriptive term.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s253"">It does not signify that the shoes are manufactured in America, or intended to be sold or used in America, nor does it indicate the quality of characteristics of the shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s254"">Indeed, it does not, in its primary signification, indicate shoes at all.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s255"">It is a fanciful designation, arbitrarily selected by complainant's predecessors to designate shoes of their manufacture.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s256"">We are convinced that it was subject to appropriation for that purpose, and it abundantly appears to have been appropriated and used by complainant and those under whom it claims.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s257"">""",Statement
35 In order to decide whether a geographic term is used descriptively one would ordinarily make the following kinds of inquiries: (1) Is the mark the name of the place from which the goods come?</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s258"">; (2) Is the geographic term likely to denote to a reasonable purchaser that the goods come from the place or region named?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s259"">; (3) Is the place or region noted for the particular goods in question?</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s260"">See generally McCarthy on Trade Marks and Unfair Competition , vol 2 SS14.7.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s261"">The result of such inquiries would likely show, for instance, that consumers would perceive as designating geographic origin the word ""Swiss"" when applied to watches, the word ""Japan"" when applied to motor vehicles, the word ""Brazil"" when applied to coffee beans and, for those with a local interest, the words ""Bank of Melbourne"" in relation to banking services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s262"">On the other hand, I am certain in my own mind that the word ""Colorado"" when applied to backpacks or other articles, such as shoes, is not used in a geographical sense.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s263"">The use of the word ""Colorado"" in connection with the kinds of goods with which we are concerned is an arbitrary use making it inherently distinctive and thus requiring no proof of secondary meaning.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s264"">36 In reaching this conclusion, I have rejected the possibility, with one slight exception, that the word ""Colorado"" can be descriptive of backpacks or shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s265"">I have referred to the evidence which is to the effect that the word ""Colorado"" conjures up notions of trekking, ruggedness, fashion, Rocky Mountains and so on.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s266"">For the most part those ideas are concerned with the image of the brand and are not descriptive of the goods themselves.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s267"">The slight exception is that the word may incidentally say something about quality (for example that the goods are ""rugged"" or durable) but because the word is only indirectly informative it is not likely to be perceived by many in a descriptive sense.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s268"">Thus the attack based on lack of distinctiveness is not made out.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s269"">37 To deal with the allegation that the trade mark registration was obtained by false suggestion or misrepresentation I need to say a little more about the facts.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s270"">Following the examination of the application for the registration of the trade mark it appeared to the examiner that there were grounds for rejecting it.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s271"">On 29 June 2001 the Registrar wrote to Colorado Group advising it of those grounds (by providing it with a copy of the examiner's report) and giving it a reasonable time within which to address those grounds.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s272"">One issue raised by the examiner was that the trade mark was not distinctive.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s273"">Relevantly the examiner's report stated:",Statement
" ""To be registrable, your trade mark must be capable of distinguishing your goods/services from the similar goods/services of other traders in the market place.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s274"">",Statement
 Your trade mark is not capable of distinguishing your goods and services because it has insufficient inherent adaptation to distinguish.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s275"">",Statement
 COLORADO is the name of a state in the USA.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s276"">Other traders are likely to need to use this name to indicate an obvious or potential connection with their goods and services.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s277"">",Statement
" However, I may be able to reconsider this matter if you provide evidence of use of your trade mark under sub-section 41(5).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s278"">""",Statement
On 8 October 2002 Colorado Group provided the Registrar with additional information in support of its application.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s279"">After considering the additional information the Registrar accepted the application and, there being no opposition to its registration, the mark was registered with effect from the date of lodgement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s280"">38 The information provided to the Registrar, and upon which the Registrar presumably relied to grant registration, included a statement of Mr Williams made a year earlier.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s281"">When it provided the additional information Colorado Group was well aware of the activities of Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s282"">More importantly, it knew about the activities of Strandbags Group as at February 2001, which was the relevant time for the purpose of considering whether the trade mark was distinctive of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s283"">Colorado Group also appreciated that it had to provide some information to the Registrar about the use to which the word ""Colorado"" had been put by Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s284"">Mr Williams' statement dealt with that matter.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s285"">He said:",Statement
" ""My recollection is that the first Colorado Bag Store opened in Sydney in 1990 or 1991.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s286"">This coincided with the introduction of the new Colorado logo.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s287"">At the time, the company [Williams the Shoemen] was concerned about its branding of the word 'Colorado' given the opening of the Colorado Bag Co Store.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s288"">",Statement
" At the time Colorado Bag Co Store started in the market, the public was familiar with 'Colorado' as a brand.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s289"">The brand had a reputation for quality built by the sale of its upmarket shoes.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s290"">At this time, the Colorado shoes had a minimum point of sale price of $60 and the $100 range of Colorado shoes was being sold in all stores.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s291"">The minimum $60 price was implemented to ensure that the Colorado brand was associated with quality.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s292"">""",Statement
39 This was much less information about Strandbags Group's activities than was actually known to Colorado Group.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s293"">Partly for that reason it is said that Mr Williams' statement was misleading, and did in fact mislead the Registrar.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s294"">The statement is said to have been misleading in the following respects (and here I quote from Strandbags Group's submissions): ""(a) at least, as to the 2001 status of the Respondent's uses, and/or (b) very possibly, so as to think that there was some relationship between the trade mark applicant and the Colorado Bag Co."" As to (b) it is not being alleged that what was said was untrue (a direct misrepresentation) but, rather, that there was an implied or inferred representation to the effect that all that was known about Colorado Bag Co was being disclosed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s295"">Further, this is not a case of omission because an omission (if there be any) must render an actual statement false for it to be a misrepresentation: Arkwright v Newbold (1881) 17 Ch D 301, 309.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s296"">I propose to proceed on that view.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s297"">40 I do not accept that the Registrar would have read Mr Williams' statement as indicating that there was some relationship between Colorado Group and Colorado Bag Co.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s298"">The last sentence of the first quoted paragraph only makes sense if there were no relationship between the two.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s299"">The other alleged misrepresentation, however, cannot be dismissed out of hand.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s300"">If what was said by Mr Williams would naturally lead the Registrar to suppose that Mr Williams had disclosed all that he knew about the activities of Colorado Bag Co he has made a representation to that effect: Lee v Jones (1864) 17 CB (NS) 482, 510.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s301"">In deciding what the Registrar would suppose, I am required to assume the Registrar is a reasonable person in that position: Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563, 576-577.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s302"">The view I take is that a reasonable Registrar would likely think that Mr Williams was providing him with information about the situation in 1991 and not as things stood in 2001.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s303"">The first paragraph is in terms confined to events in 1991 -- ""The first Colorado Bag Store opened [in] 1990 or 1991"" -- ""At the time"" this was a cause for some concern but not a major concern because ""at that time"" the brand was characteristic of Colorado Group's goods.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s304"">The reference in the second paragraph to ""At the time"" and ""at that time"" likewise points the Registrar to 1990 or 1991.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s305"">In both paragraphs Mr Williams is making what he no doubt thought was an important point (whether it was or not being irrelevant), namely, that nothing of relevance happened after 1990 or 1991 because the mark had already acquired distinctiveness.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s306"">I do not accept that Mr Williams' statement would have been understood by the Registrar as referring to ""the 2001 status of [Strandbags Group's] uses.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s307"">""",Statement
41 This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether the Registrar was in fact misled by any implied misrepresentation.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s308"">It goes without saying that it would have been near to impossible for this allegation to be made out in the absence of the Registrar, who was not called to give evidence.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s309"">42 There is in any event a complete answer to the misrepresentation case that does not at all depend upon the meaning to be attributed to Mr Williams' statement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s310"">Even if Mr Williams had set out to deceive the Registrar, the point raised by the examiner was not a good point.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s311"">This is because I do not agree with the examiner (or therefore the Registrar) that the entitlement to registration depended upon satisfaction of s 45(5).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s312"">I have already explained that when used on shoes and backpacks the mark ""Colorado"" was inherently distinctive and that there was no need for evidence of use of the mark having acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s313"">Of course the Registrar was required to determine whether the word was used in a geographical sense, but that should have taken him along a different line of inquiry.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s314"">So, if there was misrepresentation which procured the registration of the mark, as a matter of law it was a misrepresentation about an irrelevant fact.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s315"">43 Turning to infringement, I will proceed on the basis that Colorado Group is the proprietor of the mark only in respect of backpacks.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s316"">This is because in obtaining registration for goods other than backpacks and shoes Colorado Group cast its net too wide and, subject to what the parties may say about the imposition of conditions or the like, its mark should be taken off the register in relation to the goods or classes of goods for which it had not been used and which are not of the same kind as backpacks.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s317"">On this basis, the question is whether Strandbags Group's use of the marks ""Colorado"" and ""Colorado Bag Co"" in relation to the sale of backpacks is the use of a mark that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the Colorado Group trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s318"">44 Applying the principles to be gathered from cases such as Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Limited [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407, 415, it is clear beyond any doubt that Strandbags Group's use of the word ""Colorado"" infringes the trade mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s319"">A defence under s 122(1)(f) was abandoned.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s320"">The facts will not support the defence under s 124.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s321"">This is not because (as was alleged) Edgarlodge is not Strandbags Group's predecessor in title (I am sure that it is having regard to the terms of the contract of sale), but because Edgarlodge's use of ""Colorado"" on backpacks was not a prior use.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s322"">45 This brings me to the passing off claim.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s323"">There is no dispute about the elements of the cause of action.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s324"">There is a very useful summary of the five elements by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd [1979] AC 731, 742.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s325"">Here the question is whether Colorado Group can make out goodwill and misrepresentation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s326"">To prove damage it is no longer necessary to show loss of sales or disparagement of goodwill.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s327"">It is enough if the exclusivity of the goodwill is eroded: Tattinger v Allbev Limited [1992] FSR 647; Irvine v Talkspot Ltd [2002] FSR 943.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s328"">Thus if goodwill and misrepresentation are established, damages will be proven.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s329"">The case was conducted on that basis.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s330"">46 Moving to the merits, I will begin by stating two principles.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s331"">The first is so elementary that it hardly needs stating.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s332"">The principle is this.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s333"">Statute and vicarious liability apart, A cannot bring an action against B to recover damages or secure other relief for an injury done by C. The second principle is that the relevant time for determining whether there has been a passing off is the date on which the impugned conduct commenced ( Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Ltd [1981] RPC 429; J C Penney Company Inc v Penneys Ltd [1975] FSR 367) or when the passing off was first threatened ( Barnsley Brewery Co Ltd v RBNB [1997] FSR 462), whichever is the earlier.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s334"">The combined effect of the two principles is that the time at which it is necessary to assess Colorado Group's claim in passing off is 21 September 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s335"">That is the day on which Strandbags Group completed the purchase of the Edgarlodge business and commenced its use of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s336"">The earlier activities of Edgarlodge cannot be the basis for relief against Strandbags.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s337"">47 The situation as at September 1998 was that Colorado Group had a substantial reputation in the Colorado brand throughout Australia.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s338"">It had approximately 150 Williams the Shoemen and 120 Mathers stores selling Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s339"">The evidence does not show how many Colorado stores then existed but I know that by January 1999 (some three months later) there were 30 Colorado stores (up from 19 the previous year), 11 in New South Wales, 8 in Queensland, 3 in South Australia, 4 in Victoria, 1 in Western Australia, 2 in the Australian Capital Territory and 1 in the Northern Territory.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s340"">I will assume there were a few less as at September 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s341"">The total turnover of the Colorado division (that is, not including sales at Williams the Shoemen and Mathers stores) was approximately $17.15 million and $31.1 million in 1997 and 1998 respectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s342"">Advertising of Colorado products for the Colorado division was $315,000 in 1997 and $575,000 in 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s343"">If one has regard (as one should) to the sale of all Colorado products the approximate turnover in 1997 was $82.110 million and in 1998 it was $96.247 million, the total advertising costs in those years being $1.112 million and $1.347 million respectively.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s344"">48 Following its acquisition of the Edgarlodge business Strandbags Group also had a large operation selling Colorado branded products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s345"">It had acquired 25 stores, including 15 Colorado Bag Co stores that sold Colorado products.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s346"">The sale of Colorado products brought in $1,271,790 in 1997 and $2,086,218 in 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s347"">There can be no doubt that Strandbags Group also had a substantial reputation in the Colorado brand, largely centred around Queensland but not confined to that State.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s348"">49 It is worth observing, for it will become relevant in a moment, that in view of the substantial trade being done by Strandbags Group, it would have been surprising if this trade was not noticed by Colorado Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s349"">And at least by 1990 or 1991 it had been noticed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s350"">In one of those years (it is not clear which) Mr Williams saw a Colorado Bag Co store in south Sydney, possibly the Liverpool store.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s351"">He said he was ""surprised at the name of the store"" but no action was taken by him or his employer.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s352"">Mr Beagley recalled in 1992 seeing a Bagstop shop in Brisbane where handbags marked ""Colorado"" were being sold.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s353"">In 1995 at the same shopping centre he saw a Colorado Bag Co store.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s354"">When asked why Colorado Group took no action about these activities Mr Beagley interestingly said: ""We did.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s355"">We went and looked at a lot of other trade mark registrations to try and, you know, sort of put a ring fence around Colorado and try and get more registrations.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s356"">But you will note in my proposal [a reference to his earlier report suggesting the establishment of a Colorado chain] that there was concern about the vulnerability of the mark back in the early 90s.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s357"">""",Statement
50 In 1995 Colorado Group conducted a business name search of Colorado Bag Co and discovered the proprietor.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s358"">There was then an exchange of correspondence between Colorado Group and Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s359"">The letters are privileged and hence were not produced.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s360"">I have, however, been given a letter dated 13 August 1998 from Edgarlodge to Colorado Group's attorneys.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s361"">It asserts that Colorado Group's use of the word ""Colorado"" infringed Edgarlodge's own trade mark, namely the Colorado with Indian head mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s362"">The letter also alleged that by using the word ""Colorado"", Colorado Group was infringing s 52 and was passing off its goods as being those of Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s363"">In response Colorado Group demanded that Edgarlodge cease selling goods by reference to the mark ""Colorado"" but said it could use its registered mark (being the Colorado with Indian head mark).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s364"">By that time, however, Strandbags Group was on the scene and the letter was passed on to its advisers.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s365"">They issued a denial of infringement and asserted that it was ""our client's customers who have been confused"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s366"">51 While I am on the topic of awareness it is also of some relevance to note that Mr Webb, the managing director of Colorado Group, not only knew of Edgarlodge's use of the ""Colorado"" mark but also Strandbags Group's use of the mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s367"">Mr Webb first found out about the use by Edgarlodge in September 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s368"">He knew at least by 2001 that Strandbags Group had taken over the Edgarlodge business and was making extensive use of the ""Colorado"" mark.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s369"">Indeed, in 2001 he met Mr Campbell, Strandbags Group's managing director, and discussed that use.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s370"">Nothing was resolved.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s371"">The two met again in April 2004.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s372"">At that meeting Mr Webb foreshadowed the institution of this proceeding, indicating that the previous period of ""co-existence"" could not continue.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s373"">52 Now, coming back to September 1998, the position was this.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s374"">At that time both Colorado Group and Strandbags Group had a reputation in the name Colorado.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s375"">I rather think that if one were to go back to the 1980s when Williams the Shoemen's use of the name was confined to backpacks and shoes it and Edgarlodge occupied different fields of trade and it is unlikely, except for those consumers who were careless, that confusion would arise.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s376"">By the time the companies' fields of activity began to overlap (that is when Colorado Group was opening its Colorado stores and Edgarlodge was operating its Colorado Bag Co stores) there was the potential for confusion.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s377"">In the early years the different locations in which the parties operated would suggest that any confusion would not be substantial.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s378"">Moreover, the fact that Colorado Group's combination mark (word and mountain logo) was different from Edgarlodge's combination mark (word with Indian head) would also minimise the possibility of confusion.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s379"">53 Whatever be the position in the years leading up to 1998, from the time Strandbags Group purchased the Edgarlodge business both it and Colorado Group had a strong reputation in the Colorado brand.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s380"">I think this finding must put an end to the passing off claim.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s381"">In a trade mark case General Electric Co of USA v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729, 743, Lord Diplock said: ""In cases of honest concurrent user [and Strandbags Group's use is concurrent], neither of the owners of [a common law trade mark] could restrict the other from using it, but as against a usurper who infringed it either owner of the mark could obtain an injunction"".</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s382"">In a passing off case when two traders have a reputation in the same or similar names that are concurrently being used ""neither of them can be said to be guilty of any misrepresentation.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s383"">Each represents nothing but the truth, that a particular name or mark is associated with his goods or business"": Habib Bank Ltd v Habib Bank AG Zurich [1981] 1 WLR 1265, 1275 per Oliver LJ.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s384"">If in such circumstances there might be confusion that is just ""one of the misfortunes which occur in life"", but it is not actionable as a passing off: Marengo v Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic Ltd [1992] FSR 1, 2.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s385"">54 For the sake of completeness I should mention that Colorado Group did not in the action pursue a claim that Strandbags Group should be restricted in the use of its ""Colorado"" mark to a particular geographic area (for example, Queensland) or to particular kinds of goods (say, handbags).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s386"">There are many cases where a party using a mark has been restrained from extending its use in a way that will encroach upon the established reputation of a competitor either in a particular geographical area or in a particular line of business.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s387"">I mention this not to suggest that the pursuit of such a claim could have provided the applicants with some relief, but simply to show that the point has not been overlooked.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s388"">55 The claim under s 52 must fail for the same reason as the passing off claim has failed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s389"">Although a s 52 claim may succeed where a passing off claim has failed ( Peter Isaacson Publications v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1984) 3 IPR 255), when, as here, there has been no misrepresentation, the s 52 claim cannot succeed: Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s390"">By the time Strandbags Group took over the Edgarlodge business the point had been reached where the court could not interfere with that company's trading even if in the past there had been misleading conduct engaged in by Edgarlodge.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s391"">It is possible that prior to the sale Colorado Group could have taken action to restrain Edgarlodge's activities.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s392"">Having failed to take that action, it cannot now complain about what is being done by Strandbags Group.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s393"">56 Several aspects of the case remain to be dealt with because as is usual in this kind of litigation there was a split between issues concerning liability and those concerned with remedies.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s394"">I will hear from the parties on what should now be done.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s1"">2 The first proceeding to be commenced was NSD 1120 of 2005 ('the revocation proceeding'), between Alphapharm Pty Ltd ('Alphapharm') as applicant and the present applicant, H Lundbeck A/S ('Lundbeck'), as respondent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s2"">In that proceeding, Alphapharm seeks a declaration that claims 1 --- 6 of Lundbeck's Australian Patent No 623144 ('the Patent') are invalid and an order that they be revoked, or, in the alternative, an order that the Register of Patents ('the Register') be rectified pursuant to s 192 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ('the Act') to remove an extension of the term of the Patent from the Register.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s3"">Alphapharm seeks another supportive declaration related to the extension of the term of the Patent, of which I need say no more.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s4"">Lundbeck and its Australian subsidiary, Lundbeck Australia Pty Ltd ('Lundbeck Australia'), the exclusive licensee of the Patent in Australia, cross-claim against Alphapharm for infringement of the Patent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s5"">3 The second proceeding to be commenced is this present proceeding, between Lundbeck and the Commissioner of Patents ('the Commissioner').</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s6"">Lundbeck seeks relief designed to prevent the Commissioner from amending the entry in the Register in relation to the extension of the term of the Patent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s7"">The Commissioner wishes to consider and decide whether reg 10.7(7) of the Patents Regulations 1991 (Cth) ('the Regulations') requires her to amend it, but Lundbeck contends that reg 10.7(7) is invalid.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s8"">(Regulation 10.7(7) is set out at [17] below.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s9"">)",Statement
"4 Alphapharm contends that Lundbeck obtained the extension by making a misrepresentation to the Commissioner as to what was the 'first regulatory approval date' for the purposes of s 70 of the Act (s 70 is, so far as relevant, set out at [21]) and of reg 10.7(7).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s10"">It was Alphapharm which drew to the attention of the Commissioner the alleged error as to what was the true 'first regulatory approval date'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s11"">The Commissioner takes the position that if Alphapharm is correct in its contention that that date is earlier than the one on which she acted when she entered particulars of the extension in the Register, reg 10.7(7) requires her to amend the entry.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s12"">Alphapharm contends that the consequence of the alleged error is that the extension was invalidly granted and that all reference to it should be removed from the Register, whereas the Commissioner contends that the consequence is only that the entry reflects an excessively long extension, and that the Register should be amended only so as to refer to a shorter period.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s13"">5 The third proceeding is NSD 1870 of 2005 ('the TGA proceeding') between Lundbeck Australia as applicant and the Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Ageing of the Commonwealth of Australia as respondent.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s14"">In that proceeding, Lundbeck Australia applies for orders restraining the respondent ('the Secretary') from using what it contends is 'protected information' within the meaning of s 25A of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) ('the TGA') in considering any application made by any third party for registration of therapeutic goods containing (+)-citalopram.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s15"">On 15 June 2005, Alphapharm had applied to the Secretary for the registration of such therapeutic goods under the TGA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s16"">6 By orders made on 28 November 2005, I ordered that Alphapharm be joined as second respondent in the TGA proceeding.</sentence>",Statement

"10 The 'correspondence from Alphapharm Pty Ltd' referred to in para 11 of the Agreed Statement of Facts consisted of a letter dated 7 July 2005 from Mallesons Stephen Jaques ('Mallesons'), the solicitors for Alphapharm, asserting that Lundbeck had obtained the extension 'in circumstances where its application for an extension of time was out of time'.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s53"">Lundbeck's request for the extension was filed on 22 December 2003.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s54"">The pharmaceutical substance the subject of the Patent is the S-enantiomer of the compound Citalopram.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s55"">In its application for the extension, Lundbeck represented that the first goods included on the ARTG containing or consisting of this pharmaceutical substance was Lundbeck's product which bears the brand name, LEXAPRO.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s56"">LEXAPRO had been included on the ARTG only since 16 September 2003.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s57"">According to Mallesons' letter, however, the first product included in the ARTG containing the S-enantiomer of Citalopram was citalopram hydrobromide, which was registered by Lundbeck under the brand name, CIPRAMIL.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s58"">Mallesons' letter claimed that CIPRAMIL had been included in the ARTG since 20 November 1997.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s59"">In fact the correct date was 9 December 1997, but nothing turns on this discrepancy.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s60"">Alphapharm's contention is that 9 December 1997 was the date of the first inclusion in the ARTG of goods that contained the pharmaceutical substance, the S-enantiomer of Citalopram, because, according to the letter, CIPRAMIL comprises the S-enantiomer of Citalopram and the R-enantiomer of Citalopram.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s61"">11 Section 70 of the Act provides for applications for an extension of the term of standard patents relating to pharmaceutical substances.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s62"">One condition which must be satisfied in relation to at least one of the pharmaceutical substances disclosed in the complete specification falling within the scope of the claim or claims, is that the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on the first regulatory approval date for the substance is at least five years: s 70(3)(b).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s63"">For this purpose, the expression 'first regulatory approval date' in relation to a pharmaceutical substance is defined in s 70(5).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s64"">Paragraph (a) of that subsection has the effect that if, as here, no pre-TGA marketing approval was given in relation to the substance, the first regulatory approval date is the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the ARTG of goods that 'contain, or consist of' the substance.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s65"">At the heart of the dispute is whether Lundbeck's product CIPRAMIL satisfies that description.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s66"">If so, the first regulatory approval date is 9 December 1997, rather than 16 September 2003.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s67"">12 The period from the date of the Patent (13 June 1989) to 9 December 1997 is eight years, five months and twenty-six days.</sentence>",Statement

7 Section 149 Bankruptcy Act provides that a bankrupt is discharged at the end of the period of three years from the date on which the bankrupt filed his or her statement of affairs .</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s17"">It therefore follows that it is of utmost importance from the point of view of any bankrupt, including the appellant, for the purposes of facilitating prompt discharge from bankruptcy at the end of three years, that the statement of affairs be filed as soon as possible.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s18"">8 On 8 September 1998 Mr Matthew Joiner attended the appellant at the appellant's premises in Gumdale in suburban Brisbane.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s27"">In the letter, the trustee confirmed the advice of Mr Joiner that the period of bankruptcy would not commence until the statement of affairs was filed with the Official Receiver, and confirmed that the trustee's office was willing to assist the appellant with promptly completing his statement of affairs and questionnaires, and collating his personal and business books and records.</sentence>",Statement

 THE APPEAL,Statement
32 The second further amended notice of appeal ('notice of appeal') lists 13 grounds of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s86"">These grounds may be summarised as follows:",Statement
" (a) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Official Receiver of ITSA rejected the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998, when the evidence of the Official Receiver is that the 1998 Statement of Affairs was rejected and returned to the trustees on 10 February 1999 (encompassing ground 1 and 7 in the notice of appeal); (b) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the appellant did not have a reasonable basis after 9 July 1999 for believing that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been accepted by the Official Receiver, and further that his Honour erred in not finding that the appellant did not know of the non-acceptance of the 1998 Statement of Affairs until the appellant was contacted by ITSA in 2004 (encompassing grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 in the notice of appeal); (c) the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that, in contrast with the appellant's statement of affairs filed with and accepted by ITSA on 2 February 2005, the defects in the 1998 Statement of Affairs were so significant that the document was not a statement of affairs at all (encompassing grounds 9 and 10 in the notice of appeal); and (d) the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to exercise his discretion in favour of the appellant, despite the fact that the Federal Magistrate found that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been completed to the best of the appellant's ability, and, in this regard, erred in failing to find that the appellant was unable to obtain a Building Services Authority licence as a plumber while remaining an undischarged bankrupt (encompassing grounds 11, 12 and 13 in the notice of appeal).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s87"">",Statement
 GROUND (a): DATE OF REJECTION OF STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS,Statement
"33 As discussed earlier in this judgment, Mr Joiner's evidence was that the Official Receiver refused to accept delivery of the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998, and the rejected document was returned to Mr Joiner.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s88"">This is at odds with evidence of the Deputy Official Receiver that ITSA rejected the statement of affairs on 10 February 1999, and returned it to the trustees on that date.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s89"">34 Unfortunately this confusion was not resolved during the appeal.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s90"">In light of the fact that the appellant's bankruptcy would not commence until he had successfully filed a statement of affairs with the Official Receiver of ITSA, it was clearly important that the 1998 Statement of Affairs be dealt with promptly by ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s91"">If, as indicated by Mr Joiner's affidavit, ITSA had immediately rejected the 1998 Statement of Affairs, it was very important that a rejection of the form have been communicated forthwith to the appellant by the trustees to allow the appellant to immediately re-execute and re-submit a statement of affairs to ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s92"">Either way, a five month delay is not timely in any sense, given the importance of prompt filing of the statement of affairs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s93"">35 However, two issues are:",Statement
" (a) whether on the facts of this case it makes any difference whether the 1998 Statement of Affairs was rejected on 23 September 1998 or on 10 February 1999, and (b) whether the failure of the trustees to advise the appellant of the rejection of the 1998 Statement of Affairs until 10 February 1999 is determinative of the outcome of this case, in view of the relevant law and events after 10 February 1999.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s94"">",Statement
The answer to both questions is negative.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s95"">The reason is that, both before the learned Federal Magistrate and on appeal before this Court, this case turns on the application of s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s96"">Whether the Official Receiver refused to accept the 1998 Statement of Affairs on 23 September 1998 or on 10 February 1999 is relevant only to the reasonable belief of the appellant, and the exercise of the discretion of the Court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s97"">These issues are considered further in this judgment.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s98"">Accordingly, ground (a) of the appeal is rejected.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s99"">GROUND (b): REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE 1998 STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED",Statement
"36 To enliven the jurisdiction of the Court under s 33A Bankruptcy Act , the Court must find that the person believed, on reasonable grounds, that the statement of affairs had already been filed at a time before it was actually filed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s100"">The Federal Magistrate found that between 23 September 1998 and 9 July 1999, the appellant believed that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been filed, however after 9 July 1999 the appellant knew that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted by ITSA; and that even if the appellant had held that belief after 9 July 1999, it would not have been reasonable for him to hold that belief.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s101"">37 As I noted earlier, s 33A Bankruptcy Act is a relatively recent amendment to the legislation, introduced by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s102"">The explanatory memorandum is of little assistance in interpreting the section, simply noting in par 78:",Statement
" 'The effect of this new section is to allow the Court to order that a statement of affairs be treated as having been filed at a time before it was actually filed, provided that the Court is satisfied that the bankrupt believed, on reasonable grounds, that this statement had been filed at a time before it actually was filed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s103"">Proposed subs 33A(3) allows a period of grace of 30 days before the order can take effect to allow the trustee to disengage from the role of trustee.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s104"">By transitional provision item 204, the change will apply to statements of affairs filed at any time, whether before or after commencement.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s105"">'",Statement
38 There are few cases where this section has been discussed.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s106"">Counsel for the respondent helpfully referred me to two decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court where s 33A was applied, namely Chronis v DS Queen Street Mall Pty Ltd [2004] FMCA 1107 , and Sobey v Duncan [2005] FMCA 1170.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s107"">These cases are interesting as examples of fact situations which have practically arisen in relation to filing of Statements of Affairs, where Federal Magistrates applied s 33A to backdate the filing date of a statement of affairs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s108"">In both cases, the bankrupts had reasonably believed that their completed Statements of Affairs had been filed with the Official Receiver at a certain date, and had, on learning that the Statements of Affairs had not been filed at the time they had understood, had sought an order of the Court under s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s109"">In both cases, an order was given altering the filing date of the statement of affairs pursuant to s 33A.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s110"">39 In the absence of communication from the trustees that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been rejected by ITSA, it was reasonable for the appellant to believe that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been accepted by ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s111"">However, while there appears to have been some difficulty of communication with the appellant by mail, I am satisfied, as was his Honour, that by no later than 9 July 1999 the appellant knew that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted by or filed with ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s112"">40 Indeed, in my view the conclusion could be drawn that the appellant was aware by 30 June 1999 that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had not been accepted.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s113"">It was on this date that Mr Joiner and the appellant engaged in a telephone conversation where it appears that that the appellant was angry primarily because the appellant's statement of affairs had not been accepted by ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s114"">However I am content not to disturb his Honour's finding on this issue.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s115"">41 I reject the submissions of the appellant that he had not become aware of the rejection of the statement of affairs until early 2004 when he received a formal notice pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act from ITSA, and that he could have reasonably held the belief after 9 July 1999 that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been successfully filed with ITSA on 23 August 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s116"">42 On the basis that the learned Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had reasonably believed, until 9 July 1999, that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been filed, the question remains whether the subsequent sequence of events means that, on the basis of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court made in 2005, it was open to the Court to make an order effectively backdating the filing date of the statement of affairs, executed in 2005, to 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s117"">43 In my view, it was not open.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s118"">On the facts of this case as outlined earlier in this judgment, it is clear that several years had passed between the attempted filing of the 1998 Statement of Affairs, and the actual filing of a statement of affairs by the appellant in 2005.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s119"">During this time the appellant had no basis on which to reasonably believe, and indeed knew, that the document he had submitted for filing in 1998 had not been accepted by the Official Receiver of ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s120"">In my respectful view, the section does not contemplate a bankrupt being aware for several years that his or her statement of affairs has not been accepted for filing because it was defective, and then claiming that he or she had, temporarily, a reasonable belief several years before making application to the Court, that the statement of affairs had been filed.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s121"">In my view, knowledge of this kind does not accord with 'reasonable belief' within the meaning of s 33A(2).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s122"">44 On the evidence before me I am satisfied that his Honour was correct in the findings he made at first instance.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s123"">Accordingly, ground (b) of the appeal is rejected.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s124"">GROUND (c): DEFECTS IN THE 1998 STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS",Statement
45 The result of rejection of ground (b) of the appeal means that the jurisdiction of the Court is not enlivened under s 33A(2).</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s125"">However, even if the Appellant had sought an order from the Court upon learning that the 1998 Statement of Affairs had been rejected in July 1999, in my view the appellant would not have been assisted by s 33A Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s126"">The reason for this is that, as found by the learned Federal Magistrate, the defects in the 1998 Statement of Affairs were so significant that it could not be said that the document was a statement of affairs at all.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s127"">Further, his Honour found that the defects could not be described as 'formal' or 'irregularities' for the purposes of s 306 Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s128"">46 The form and content of a statement of affairs for the purposes of s 54(1) Bankruptcy Act is prescribed by s 6A(2) which states:",Statement
 'A reference in a provision of this Act referred to in subs (1) to a statement of affairs is a reference to a statement that:,Statement

"47 Interestingly, s 54(1) requires the bankrupt to:",Statement
 'make out and file with the Official Receiver for the District in which the sequestration order was made a statement of his or her affairs.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s130"">'",Statement
 This clearly means a bankrupt is required to:,Statement
" (a) make out and file with the Official Receiver a statement of affairs in the form approved by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and published in the Commonwealth Gazette from time to time (as required by s 6A) , and (b) because the required statement is a statement of the bankrupt's affairs: complete that form with personal information as required by the form.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s131"">",Statement
"Obviously, it would not satisfy s 54(1) for a bankrupt to seek to file a blank statement of affairs in the form approved by the Inspector-General without including the personal information required by the form, because then the form would not be a statement of the bankrupt's personal affairs as required by the section.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s132"">48 The significance of the statement of affairs was explained by Hill J in Nilant v Macchia [2000] FCA 1528 ; (2000) 104 FCR 238 at 245, [2000] FCA 1528 ; 178 ALR 371 at 377 where his Honour said:",Statement
" 'The obligation to file a statement of affairs in a public register is intended to make information concerning the bankrupt's affairs available to creditors and, for that matter, members of the public.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s133"">The former may inspect without payment of a fee, the latter only on payment of a fee.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s134"">But it is in the interests of the public in the encouragement of morality in trading that the financial situation of a bankrupt debtor be open to inspection.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s135"">Because, ordinarily, the administration of the estate and ultimate distribution of dividends from the estate, will be dependent upon the trustee having full details of the trade dealings and debts of a debtor, the statement is to be made available as well to the trustee in bankruptcy.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s136"">'",Statement
"49 The appellant has confined his argument to the finding of his Honour that the document attempted by the appellant was so defective as not to be a 'statement of affairs', and has submitted that his Honour was in error in so finding.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s137"">The appellant has not submitted that s 306(1) is applicable in relation to the 1998 Statement of Affairs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s138"">50 Although there are a number of decisions of this Court considering issues raised by defective statements of affairs under s 54(1) Bankruptcy Act , most commonly in this context the Court has been asked to consider the application of s 306(1) Bankruptcy Act to cure irregularities in statements of affairs.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s139"">The leading case in this context is Nilant v Macchia , cited earlier, which considered, inter alia , whether failure to comply with s 54(1) gave rise to a 'proceeding' under the Bankruptcy Act capable of being brought before the Court.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s140"">The appellant before me has not sought to rely on s 306 in this case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s141"">Nonetheless comments by the court in Nilant v Macchia , which deals with both s 54(1) and s 306(1) , are, by analogy, apposite to the circumstances of this case.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s142"">In particular, Weinberg J at ALR 383-384 noted:",Statement
" 'Where there has been an attempt to comply with the obligations of s 54(1) , whether within the 14-day period specified, or on some occasion thereafter, it is entirely apt to speak of that attempt as being a ""proceeding under this Act"", and as being capable of being regarded by the court as 'not invalidated' by reason of any formal defect or error....It follows that the bankruptcy will not continue for an unconscionably long period merely because of some relatively minor failure on the part of the bankrupt to comply with the strict requirements of s 54(1)",Statement
" (384) Regrettably, it seems to me that s 306(1) cannot be invoked in the circumstances of the present case, where no step whatever has been taken by the bankrupt in purported compliance with the requirements of s 54(1).... ' (emphasis added)",Statement
51 An examination of the 1998 Statement of Affairs reveals that very little of the document was genuinely attempted by the appellant.</sentence>,Statement
"<sentence id=""s143"">As noted by the learned Federal Magistrate, the document failed to:",Statement
" (a) properly identify the bankrupt; (b) provide an overall summary of his assets and liabilities; (c) provide details, if any, of any insurance and superannuation policies; (d) list any assets of any description owned by him; (e) fully identify his unsecured creditors; (f) provide complete details of his debts; (g) advise his date of birth; (h) provide his work and mobile telephone numbers; (i) provide his then current residential address; (j) provide his driver's licence details; (k) list his addresses (excluding his then current address) in the five years prior to him becoming bankrupt; (l) disclose that he had been bankrupt in the 10 years prior to this bankruptcy; (m) list all Court actions in which he was then currently involved; (n) list all assets worth more than $1000 sold, transferred or given away or otherwise disposed of in the two years prior to him being made bankrupt; (o) list any persons or entities who owned or held any assets of which he had contributed moneys for which he had helped to buy or improve in the five years prior to being made bankrupt; (p) list all creditors who had been paid over $1000 or seized any of his assets in the past 12 months before becoming bankrupt, as a result of pressure for payment.</sentence>",Statement

"60 As demonstrated both before the learned Federal Magistrate and this Court, a significant proportion of the interaction between the appellant, the trustees and Mr Joiner could be described as attempts by the trustees and Mr Joiner to obtain a statement of affairs in acceptable form from the appellant for filing with ITSA, and what appears to have been on-going resistance by --- or at best, genuine lack of appreciation and hence indifference of --- the appellant to the obligation of completing a statement of affairs in a proper form.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s173"">The appellant indicated to this court the frustration he experienced in attempting to complete the form in 1998.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s174"">However, it is clear that the trustees and Mr Joiner made every attempt --- at least from February 1999 --- to communicate with the appellant and inform him of the importance of completing and filing the statement of affairs, and repeatedly offered him assistance to complete it in a form acceptable to ITSA.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s175"">61 The appellant appeared to take the view before the learned Federal Magistrate, and continued before me to take the view, that once a signed statement of affairs is provided to the trustee or submitted to ITSA by the bankrupt, then, notwithstanding the adequacy or otherwise of the material entered in the form, there is no discretion in the trustee to return the form to the bankrupt, or ITSA to reject it (TS 11, ll 13-21).</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s181"">It was the appellant who chose not to take advantage of repeated offers of assistance from the trustees.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s185"">As explained earlier in this judgment in the discussion of ground (c) of this appeal, the 1998 Statement of Affairs submitted by the appellant to the trustees was so defective as not to be a statement of the appellant's affairs.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s192"">It seems clear that, despite repeated attempts of the trustees to explain the position to him, the appellant chose to ignore this advice, or obstinately refused to co-operate on the basis that he had already provided the 1998 Statement of Affairs, and he was prepared to do no more.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s193"">67 The appellant also strongly argued that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that, the appellant, while a bankrupt, could not obtain a Building Services Authority licence as a plumber while remaining an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s195"">68 Minimal evidence was lead in this regard, although I understand that the Queensland Building Services Authority publishes financial requirements for licensing which must be met by applicants for a licence under the Queensland Building Services Authority Act 1991 (Qld).</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s196"">69 Notwithstanding the lack of evidence before me on this issue, it is possible that the appellant is correct in his submission concerning his inability to hold a Building Services Authority licence while he is an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s197"">However, it is also possible that, given the appellant's current financial situation, he would be unable to satisfy financial requirements necessary to obtain a licence if he were discharged from bankruptcy forthwith.</sentence>",Statement

"<sentence id=""s199"">70 In my view, whether or not the appellant would be able to obtain a Building Services Authority licence were he to be discharged from bankruptcy forthwith is only relevant in the case before me to the extent that it goes to whether the learned Federal Magistrate should have exercised his discretion under s 33A in the appellant's favour.</sentence>",Statement
"<sentence id=""s200"">71 Given the lack of co-operation of the appellant in this matter with the trustees, and his views towards completing a statement of affairs in a form capable of being filed until 2005, no evidence has been lead before me which persuades me that the Federal Magistrate was in error in failing to exercise his discretion in favour of the appellant.</sentence>",Statement
